    <p class="initial"><strong>Languages:</strong> Automatic and bonus languages for all races appear in the 
    race descriptions, since the Regions of Mystara are home to a number of unique 
    tongues. For races that are listed with the term &quot;local regional language&quot; and 
    &quot;local common&quot;, the actual languages that apply are based on their &quot;home region&quot; 
    (i.e., the region of Mystara from which they originated). See the regional discussions 
    under the <a href="regions.html">Mystara Settings</a> section for complete 
    details.</p>
    <p class="stb"><strong>Regions:</strong> Each race description includes a listing of the 
    Mystara settings, and the regions therein where that race is most commonly found. 
    It may also include notes regarding regions where there are particular reasons 
    the race would be particularly rare. Players and DMs should not feel restricted 
    by this information in their selection of a home region for any given character, 
    although a DM may, based on this information, decide that certain choices will 
    require a particularly interesting background story to be acceptable.</p>
    <p>Additionally, the availability of regional feats and equipment for starting 
    characters may depend on whether her home region is a preferred region for her, 
    based on race and starting class. See the <a href="classes.html">Classes of Mystara</a>,
    <a href="skillsfeats.html">Skills and Feats</a> and <a href="equipment.html">Equipment</a>

    The dour and taciturn rockborn dwarves can be found in most places throughout 
    this region of <strong class="mystarared">Mystara</strong>, frequently acting in the roles 
    of stonemason, weaponsmith or armorsmith.&nbsp; The largest concentration of 
    rockborn dwarves is found in the country of Rockhome, which is the ancestral 
    home of their people. Other countries where rockborn dwarves are likely to be 
    found include: Darokin; Karameikos; Minrothad (esp. Fortress Island); Thyatis; 
    Ylaruam. One country you can almost be certain a rockborn dwarf is NOT from 
    is Glantri, where dwarves have sometimes been treated as little more than lab 
    specimens by wizards intent on learning the secrets behind this race&#39;s innate 
    resistance to physical damage caused by spells and spell-like effects.</li>
    <li><strong>Ability Modifiers:</strong> +2 Constitution, -2 Charisma.</li>
    <li><strong>Size and Speed</strong>: Medium size; Rockhome dwarf base speed is 20 ft.</li>
    <li><strong>Darkvision</strong>: Dwarves can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Darkvision 
    is black and white only, but it is otherwise like normal sight, and dwarves 
    can function just fine with no light at all.</li>
    <li><strong>Saving Throw Bonus</strong>: +2 racial bonus on saving throws against poison; 
    +2 racial bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like effects;</li>
    <li><strong>Stonecunning</strong>: Stonecunning grants dwarves a +2 racial bonus on checks 
    to notice unusual stonework, such as sliding walls, stonework traps, new construction 
    (even when built to match the old), unsafe stone surfaces, shaky stone ceilings, 
    and the like. Something that isn&#39;t stone but that is disguised as stone also 
    counts as unusual stonework. A dwarf who merely comes within 10 feet of unusual 
    stonework can make a check as if he were actively searching, and a dwarf can 
    use the Search skill to find stonework traps as a rogue can. A dwarf can also 
    intuit depth, sensing his approximate depth underground as naturally as a human 
    can sense which way is up. Dwarves have a sixth sense about stonework, an innate 
    ability that they get plenty of opportunity to practice and hone in their underground 
    homes.</li>
    <li><strong>Stone and Metal Craft</strong>: +2 racial bonus on Craft checks that are related 
    to stone or metal; +2 racial bonus on Appraise checks that are related to stone 
    or metal items. </li>
    <li><strong>Traditional Enemies</strong>: +1 racial bonus to attack rolls against orcs 
    and goblinoids (goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears); +4 dodge bonus against giants.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Automatic Languages</strong>: Local Regional Language, Local Common (if different 
    from Local Regional Language) and Dwarven.</li>
    <li><strong>Bonus Languages</strong>: Giant, Gnome, Terran, Local Regional and Local Goblinoid 
    languages. (Exact list of available bonus local languages varies with region.)
    </li>
    <li><strong>Favored Class</strong>: Fighter. A multiclass Rockhome dwarf&#39;s fighter class 
    does not count when determining whether he suffers an XP penalty (see &quot;Experience 
    for Multiclass Characters&quot; in <cite>Chapter 3: Classes</cite> of the <cite>Player&#39;s 
    Handbook</cite>).</li>

    <p class="initial">Wood Elves are the prototypical elf race in Mystara.&nbsp; 
    After the Great Rain of Fire, the hero Ilsundal, who would eventually become 
    the main Immortal patron of the elven people, lead the ancestors of the wood 
    elf people out of the Sylvan Realm, to the western regions of the continent

<p class="initial">Wood elf characters have the following racial traits:</p>
<div class="sidebar float-right">
    <div class="invisible"><p class="initial"><a title="Skip past the sidebar to the start of 
    the content." accesskey="S" href="#endElfSidebar"><u>S</u>kip over sidebar</a></p></div>
    <h4>Inherently Magical Elves (Variant)</h4>
    <p class="initial">In 0E D&amp;D, all elves are predefined as having skills and 
    abilities equivalent to a multi-classed Fighter-Wizard.&nbsp; Although this 
    is a mechanic of the rules in use, and not, strictly speaking, defined by the
    <strong class="mystarared">Mystara</strong> setting, it did have a side effect on the 
    setting.&nbsp; Specifically, it is common knowledge across all of Mystara that 
    all elves know arcane magic and are proficient with martial arms and all forms 
    of armor.</p>
    <p>The official <strong class="mystarared">Mystara-3E</strong> conversion of the 
	<strong class="mystarared">Mystaran</strong> Wood Elf 
    uses the &quot;Elven Magical Training&quot; regional feat to emulate the traditional arcane 
    nature of elves in the setting.&nbsp; However, it must be said that the members 
    of the <strong class="mystarared">Mystara-3E</strong> Project team were highly divided 
    on whether to use this feat, which does not require all wood elves to exhibit 
    skill with magical, or to grant all wood elves an inherent magical trait, similar 
    to that of the standard D&amp;D 3E gnome race and balanced by the reduction or elimination 
    of other standard traits.</p>
    <p>Since the team was so highly divided on this issue, and the decision to use 
    the <strong>Magical Training</strong> regional feat was so close, we also offer DMs the 
    following variant option for the Mystara Wood Elf race:</p>
    <p class="initial"><strong>Inherent Magic</strong>: Wood elves with Intelligence scores 
    of 10 or higher may cast the 0-level spells (cantrips) <em>daze</em>, <em>detect 
    magic</em>, and <em>prestidigitation</em>, each once per day. These are arcane 
    spells. Treat the wood elf as a 1st-level caster for all spell effects dependent 
    on level (range for daze and duration for detect magic). See the spell descriptions 
    in <cite>Chapter 11: Spells</cite> of the <cite>Player&#39;s Handbook</cite>.</p>
    <p>To fully balance this benefit, remove the <strong>Sleep Immunity</strong> trait, including 
    the elven ability to trance rather than sleep.</p>
    <p>Note that this does not remove the <strong>Magical Training</strong> regional feat 
    from the setting entirely, as it may still be taken by non-elves who have been 
    formally adopted into a elven clan.</p>
    <a name="endElfSidebar" id="endElfSidebar"></a></div>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Regions</strong>: <em>(<a href="regions.html#KnownWorld">The Known World</a>)</em> 
    While Mystaran wood elves mingle freely with the other races throughout this 
    region of <strong class="mystarared">Mystara</strong> they are most likely to be found 
    in the following countries: Alfheim; Darokin; Karameikos; Glantri; Minrothad 
    (esp. Alfeisle); Thyatis (esp. Vyalia County); Wendar, </li>
    <li><strong>Ability Modifiers:</strong> +2 Intelligence, -2 Constitution: Mystaran wood 
    elves value study and contemplation over the feats of agility learned by many 
    elves of other worlds. </li>
    <li><strong>Size and Speed:</strong> Medium size; Elven base speed is 30 ft. </li>
    <li><strong>Low-light Vision</strong>: Wood elves can see twice as far as a human in starlight, 
    moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. They retain 
    the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.</li>
    <li><strong>Sleep Immunity</strong>:&nbsp; Immunity to magic sleep spells and effects. 
    In addition, wood elves do not sleep, but instead meditate in a deep trance 
    for 4 hours. (For the complete description of the elven trance, see <em>Elves</em> 
    in <cite>Chapter 2: Races</cite> of the <cite>Player&#39;s Handbook</cite>.)</li>
    <li><strong>Saving Throw Bonus</strong>: +2 racial saving throw bonus against Enchantment 
    spells or effects. </li>
    <li><strong>Keen Observation</strong>: +2 racial bonus on Listen, Search, and Spot checks. 
    An elf who merely passes within 5 feet of a secret or concealed door is entitled 
    to a Search check to notice it as if she were actively looking for the door</li>
    <li><strong>Weapon Proficiencies</strong>: All wood elves are proficient with either longsword 
    or rapier; and with shortbow, longbow, composite longbow, and composite shortbow.</li>
    <li><strong>Automatic Languages</strong>: Local Regional Language, Local Common (if different 
    from Local Regional Language) and Elven.</li>
    <li><strong>Bonus Languages</strong>: Draconic, Sylvan, Local Regional and Local Goblinoid 
    languages. (Exact list of available local languages varies with region.)
    </li>
    <li><strong>Favored Class</strong>: Wizard. A multiclass wood elf&#39;s wizard class does 
    not count when determining whether he suffers an XP penalty (see &quot;Experience 
    for Multiclass Characters&quot; in <cite>Chapter 3: Classes</cite> of the <cite>Player&#39;s 
    Handbook</cite>).</li>
    <li><strong>Magical Training</strong>:&dagger; To many outsiders, it almost seems as if every 
    elf, regardless of profession or role, has been trained in the use of some small 
    amount of arcane magic. In point of fact, traditional wood elf society has a 
    great deal of respect for those who take it upon themselves to learn even the 
    most basic tenets of wizardry. Thus, members of any traditional elven society 
    - whether membership is by birth or adoption - who also have the aptitude for 
    wizardly magic (Intelligence 10+), meet all the prerequisites for the 
	<strong>
    <a href="skillsfeats.html#ElvenMagicalTraining">Elven Magical Training</a></strong> regional 
    feat.</li>
    <li><strong>Fighting Magi</strong>:&dagger; Traditionally, wood elves place an equally great 
    emphasis on the skilled use of both arcane and martial training. As a result, 
    any individual who has been trained in their first level of Wizard by a member 
    of a traditional elven society (or by someone else who was so trained) are always 
    taught the skill of casting arcane magic without fear of failure due to the 
    restrictions of armor.<br />
    <em>Result:</em> Instead of gaining the <em>Scribe Scroll </em>feat at 1st-level, 
    elven-trained Wizards automatically gain the <em>Still Spell</em> feat, and thus 
    immediately gain the ability to memorize any spell in a slot one level higher 
    in exchange for the ability to cast it without fear of failure due to physical 
    restrictions of any kind (including those caused by most armor). Note that at 
    first level, the elven-trained wizard may only apply this feat to cantrips.</li>
</ul>
<p class="initial">&dagger; There are several regions in Mystara that are specifically 
known to be strongholds of traditional elven society. Where this is the case, it 
is noted where the relevant regions are described in detail (see the
<a href="regions.html">Mystaran Settings</a> section). A DM may define any 
community of wood elves as a &quot;traditional elven society&quot; simply by having it supply 
the benefits, and adhere to the restrictions, specified for these two traits.</p>

<p class="initial">Earth gnome characters have the following racial traits:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Regions</strong>: (<em>The Known World</em>) Earth gnomes do not have a country 
    they call their own and they are much less common than the other core races 
    throughout this region of <strong class="mystarared">Mystara</strong>.
    <span class="redfont">Major concentrations of Gnomes can be found amongst the 
    dwarves of Rockhome, and there are several gnomish communities in the hillier 
    regions of the midlands of Karameikos</span>, most notably the gnome stronghold 
    of Highforge. Gnomes who are not from one of these larger communities are generally 
    from the larger, more cosmopolitan areas, where gemcutters, mechanics or sages 
    are in high demand. The most common countries an adventuring Gnome could be 
    from include: Darokin (esp. Darokin City, Athenos, Selenica); Karameikos
    <span class="redfont">(esp. Highforge, Specularum)</span>; Ierendi (esp. Ierendi 
    City); Minrothad (esp. Minrothad City); Rockhome and Thyatis (esp. Thyatis City);</li>
    <li><strong>Ability Modifiers:</strong> +2 Constitution, -2 Strength.</li>
    <li><strong>Size and Speed</strong>: Small size; Earth gnome base speed is 20 ft.</li>
    <li><strong>Low-light Vision</strong>: Earth gnomes can see twice as far as a human in 
    starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. 
    They retain the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.</li>
    <li><strong>Saving Throw Bonus</strong>: +1 racial bonus on saving throws against earth-based 
    spells and attacks, including acid and petrifaction.</li>
    <li><strong>Stonecunning</strong>: Stonecunning grants earth gnomes a +2 racial bonus 
    on checks to notice unusual stonework, such as sliding walls, stonework traps, 
    new construction (even when built to match the old), unsafe stone surfaces, 
    shaky stone ceilings, and the like. Something that isn&#39;t stone but that is disguised 
    as stone also counts as unusual stonework. An earth gnome who merely comes within 
    10 feet of unusual stonework can make a check as if he were actively searching, 
    and an earth gnome can use the Search skill to find stonework traps as a rogue 
    can. An earth gnome can also intuit depth, sensing his approximate depth underground 
    as naturally as a human can sense which way is up. Earth gnomes have a sixth 
    sense about stonework, an innate ability that they, like their
    <a href="races.html">Rockhome Dwarf</a> cousins (with whom they share much 
    in common), get plenty of opportunity to practice and hone in their underground 
    homes.</li>
    <li><strong>Stone and Metal Craft</strong>: +2 racial bonus on Craft checks that are related 
    to stone or metal; +2 racial bonus on Appraise checks that are related to stone 
    or metal items: Earth gnomes share the Dwarves&#39; particular affinity to stone 
    and metalwork. </li>
    <li><strong>Invention</strong>: +1 racial bonus on Craft checks that are related to machinery 
    and works of Engineering; +2 racial bonus on Alchemy checks: earth gnomes love 
    to tinker and create all kinds of wonderful inventions involving strange mechanism 
    and frequently explosive chemical reactions.</li>
    <li><strong>Traditional Enemies</strong>: +1 racial bonus to attack rolls against kobolds 
    and goblinoids (goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears); +4 dodge bonus against giants: 
    earth gnomes battle these creatures frequently and practice special techniques 
    for fighting or avoiding them. </li>
    <li><strong>Automatic Languages</strong>: Local Regional Language, Local Common (if different 
    from Local Regional Language) and Gnome.</li>
    <li><strong>Bonus Languages</strong>: Draconic, Dwarven, Elven, Giant, Local Regional 
    and Local Goblinoid languages. (Exact list of available bonus languages varies 
    with region.)&nbsp; Earth gnomes deal more with elves and dwarves than elves 
    and dwarves deal with one another, and they learn the languages of their enemies 
    (kobolds, giants, goblins and orcs) as well.</li>
    <li><strong>Speak with Burrowing Creatures</strong>: Once per day, an earth gnome can 
    use <em>speak with animals</em> as a spell-like ability to speak with a burrowing 
    mammal (a badger, fox, rabbit etc.). This ability is innate to earth gnomes. 
    It has a duration of 1 minute (the earth gnome is considered a 1<sup>st</sup>-level 
    caster when he uses this ability, regardless of his actual level). See the
    <em>speak with animals</em> spell description in <cite>Chapter 11: Spells</cite> 
    of the <cite>Player&#39;s Handbook</cite>.</li>
    <li><strong>Favored Class</strong>: Rogue. A multiclass earth gnome&#39;s rogue class does 
    not count when determining whether he suffers an XP penalty (see &quot;Experience 
    for Multiclass Characters&quot; in <cite>Chapter 3: Classes</cite> of the <cite>Player&#39;s

    Skygnomes are agile, sure-footed and fearless of heights.</li>
    <li><strong>Aerial Acrobats:</strong>&Dagger; +2 luck bonus to reflex saves when attempting to 
    prevent falling from any heights greater than 10 feet. This ability only works 
    in a skygnome&#39;s natural habitat (the sky).</li>
    <li><strong>Invention</strong>: +1 racial bonus on Craft checks that are related to machinery 
    and works of Engineering; +2 racial bonus on Alchemy checks: earth gnomes love 
    to tinker and create all kinds of wonderful inventions involving strange mechanism 
    and frequently explosive chemical reactions.</li>
    <li><strong>Automatic Languages</strong>: Local Regional Language, Local Common (if different 
    from Local Regional Language) and Gnome.</li>
    <li><strong>Bonus Languages: </strong>Draconic, Dwarven, Elven and the Local Regional 
    Languages of the areas that Serraine or the flying continent of Valoin-Flamaeker 
    regularly travel over. A list of &quot;fly over&quot; regions is included in the regional 
    write up for both Serraine and Valoin-Flamaeker. Exactly which other languages 
    are available varies based on that information. </li>
    <li><strong>Favored Class:</strong> Rogue or Expert. A multiclass skygnome&#39;s rogue or 
    expert class (whichever has the highest class level) will not count when determining 
    whether he suffers an XP penalty (see &quot;Experience for Multiclass Characters&quot; 
    in <cite>Chapter 3: Classes</cite> of the <cite>Player&#39;s Handbook</cite>).</li>
</ul>
<p class="initial">&dagger; These abilities effectively <em>replace</em> the standard earth 
gnome abilities and bonuses related to earth, stone and metal: saving throws vs. 
earth based magic, stonecunning, appraisal, stone and metal craft and the language 
ability to <em>speak with animals</em>. <strong class="mystarared">Mystaran</strong> skygnomes have abandoned most of 
their ancestral affinity for earth and metal in exchange for their affinity with 
the air and sky.</p>
<p class="initial">&Dagger; These abilities effectively <em>replace</em> the standard earth 
gnome abilities and bonuses related to combat with the traditional enemies: attacks 
vs. kobolds and golblinoids and AC bonus vs. Giants. <strong class="mystarared">Mystaran</strong> skygnomes have virtually 
no contact with the &quot;traditional&quot; enemies of their earth gnome cousins and so no 
longer emphasize the skills required to attack and defend against them effectively. 
Instead they have refocused their natural skills and abilities towards dealing with 
the dangers they do encounter regularly, and thus gain an increased effectiveness 
and awareness in precarious locations.</p>

    <h3 class="mtb"><a name="halfelves" id="halfelves"></a>Half-Elves</h3>
    <p class="comments initial">Although the <cite>Elves of Alfheim</cite> 
	Gazetteer [<a href="lore.html#GAZ5">GAZ 5</a>] states that 
	&quot;the half-elf does not exist&quot;, other <strong class="mystarared">Mystaran</strong> material, in both 0E and 2E, acknowledge that 
	when elf and human do produce offspring, they may give rise to children
with both elf and human features. Accordingly, the Mystara-3E development group 
	concluded that the 
	&quot;legendary half-elf&quot; from <cite>Elves of Alfheim</cite> refers to a mythical paragon 
	possessing all the positive attributes and none of the imperfections of 
	both Elves and Humans combined, and thus the standard 3E half-elf, being no such paragon, does indeed exist in <strong class="mystarared">Mystara</strong>.</p>
	<p class="initial">

Use the following guidelines for <strong class="mystarared">Mystaran</strong> half-elves:</p><p>

In <strong class="mystarared">Mystara</strong>, all human/elf offspring can be 
referred to as half-elves with the physical features of both races, but some 
have all human racial abilities, some have all elf racial abilities and some 
may, indeed, have standard 3E half-elf racial- abilities. All half-elves, 
regardless of which racial abilities they possess, also gain the elven-blood racial 
ability.&nbsp; Half-elves may also be assigned initial languages based on whether they grew up with Elves or Humans 
and choosing whether they substitute Still Spell for Scribe Scroll when becoming 
wizards (see the <b>Fighting Magi</b> ability of the <a href="#elves">Mystaran Elves</a> for more details) will depend on whether they learned their 
first level of the wizard class from a traditional Elf community or not. </p><p>

As described in <cite>Elves of Alfheim</cite>, <strong class="mystarared">Mystaran</strong> elf and human genetics 
are not 100% compatible and, unfortunately, certain pairings may 
not produce viable offspring.&nbsp; Specifically, when a female human and a male 
elf produce male offspring the child will always be stillborn.&nbsp; All 
offspring expected from different human and elf pairings are described below:</p>
	<dl compact="compact">
		<dt><strong>Female human and male elf</strong></dt>
		<dd>
		<ul type="disc">
			<li><em>Female offspring</em>: half-elf with human or half-elf racial features.</li>
			<li><em>Male offspring</em>: stillborn</li>
		</ul>
		</dd>
		<dt><strong>Female elf and male human</strong></dt>
		<dd>
		<ul type="disc">
<li><em>Female offspring</em>: half-elf with human or half-elf racial features.</li>
<li><em>Male offspring</em>: half-elf with elf or half-elf racial features.</li></ul></dd>
	</dl>
	<p>

As a result of the same incompatibility between elf and human genetics,
<strong class="mystarared">Mystaran</strong> half-elves do not always 
&quot;breed true&quot; with each other or with humans and elves.&nbsp; The 
offspring expected from different half-elf and half-elf, human or elf pairings 
are described below:</p>
	<dl compact="compact">
		<dt><strong>Female half-elf and male half-elf</strong></dt>
		<dd>
		<ul type="disc">
			<li><em>Female offspring</em>: 50% - half-elf with human or half-elf racial features; 
50% - pure elf.</li>
			<li><em>Male offspring</em>: 50% - half-elf with elf or half-elf 
			racial features; 50% - pure human who does not inherit the elven-blood 
racial trait.</li>
		</ul>
		</dd>
		<dt><strong>Female half-elf and male human</strong></dt>
		<dd>
		<ul type="disc">
<li><em>Female offspring</em>: 50% - half-elf with human or half-elf racial

    be from is Glantri, where Halflings have sometimes been treated as little more 
    than lab specimens by wizards hoping to learn the secrets behind their race&#39;s
