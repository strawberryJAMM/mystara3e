		<h4>Differences from 0e Planar Geography Explained<br />
		<em style="FONT-SIZE: 0.8em">Commentary on the Transitive Planes</em>
		</h4>
		<hr />
	  <p class="initial" style="FONT-SIZE: 0.8em"><strong>Prof. Xander von Humburdt, 
		Dept. of Planar Geography, University of Thyatis, AC1000</strong> </p>
		<p class="initial"><em>&quot;Those of you who have seen maps depicting the planar 
		geography of the Multiverse dimension may be wondering about the absence 
		of the Astral and the Shadow from most of them.</em> </p>
		<p><em>&quot;It is a well known fact among appropriately learned individuals 
		that the Ethereal, Astral, and Shadow Planes are not truly planes at all. 
		They are, rather, nothing more than the 'space between' the planes, as is 
		immediately obvious to anyone who has purposefully, or accidentally, set 
		foot into any one of these achromatic regions devoid, as they are, of the 
		planets, suns and deep void of space that are found on any true plane. These 
		regions, when they are discussed by scholars at any length, are frequently 
		grouped together and referred to, somewhat erroneously, as the 'transitive 
		planes'. </em></p>
		<p><em>&quot;While they are not planes in the true sense of the word they are 
		certainly transitive and it is theorized that the extra-dimensional, distance 
		distorting, properties of these regions are required for the successful 
		execution of most spells that summon, conjure or facilitate intra- and extra-dimensional 
		travel.</em> </p>
		<p><em>&quot;The Astral and Shadow Planes are commonly omitted from Cosmological 
		Maps, as they are of little direct interest to most planar travelers. The 
		Ethereal, on the other hand, is usually included specifically because it 
		sits in a unique position relative to the major planes of the Multiverse.</em>
		</p>
		<p><em>&quot;In particular, while it is strongly held that the Astral and the 
		Shadow must connect in some fashion to virtually every other plane in the 
		Multiverse except each other, it has been shown, without doubt, that the 
		Ethereal does not connect to any plane beyond the Astraline. (As an aside, 
		the Astraline is so named because it was once thought to actually
		<strong>be</strong> the Astral plane, primarily due to a combination of 
		miscommunication and poor record keeping on the part of the earliest pioneers 
		of planar geography).</em> </p>
		<p><em>&quot;Therefore, the Ethereal is always included in planar maps of the 
		Multiverse dimension as it is one of the stepping stones used by planar 
		travelers traveling between Inner and Outer planes.&quot;</em> </p>
		<hr />

		Explorer and Planar Vagabond</strong> </p>
		<p class="initial"><em>&quot;The Ethereal, Astral and Shadow not true planes? 
		Pshaw! I've been there - to all three, and many planes more than you'll 
		read about in your precious books I'd wager - and the transitives may not

		just as much a plane as any other I've been to.</em> </p>
		<p><em>&quot;And don't let those academics fool you into thinking that there's 
		no interest in visiting the Astral or the Shadow neither. If you wander 
		them long enough, you can meet up with all kinds of interesting... well,

		you think you really are crazy, but that's just the way it is way out there, 
		in the spaces that are between everything else.</em> </p>
		<p><em>&quot;Still, don't ever think that the transitives aren't dangerous - 
		especially the Shadow. Those that try to find their way into the Deep Shadow 
		are down-right crazed if you ask me - crazier than me anyway. I don't know 
		whether the crackpot theories about a plane filled with negative energy 
		are true or not but, either way, I'm not about to go way out there just 
		to find out.</em> </p>
		<p><em>&quot;As for me... well, I may not think the Shadow is a lovely day in

	<p class="initial">The transitive planes have one important common characteristic: 
	Each is used to get from one place to another. The Astral Plane and the Shadow 
	Plane are both conduits to all other planes except each other, while the Ethereal 
	Plane serves as means of transportation within and between the Prime Plane and 
	the Elemental Planes it connects. In general, these planes have the strongest 
	regular interaction with the Material Plane and are often accessed by using 
	various spells. They also have native inhabitants as well. </p>
	<h4><a name="InnerPlanes" id="InnerPlanes"></a>Inner Planes </h4>
	<p class="initial">These planes are manifestations of the basic elemental building 
	blocks of the universe. Each is made up of a single type of element that overwhelms 
	all others. The natives of a particular Inner Plane are made of the same element 
	as the plane itself. </p>
	<h4><a name="Astraline" id="Astraline"></a>Astraline Plane </h4>
	<p class="initial">While the Prime Plane and Elemental Planes all float within 
	the encompassing bubble of the Ethereal Plane, the Ethereal Plane itself is 
	completely enclosed by an intermediary plane called the Astraline (so named 
	because early planar travelers from <strong class="mystarared">Mystara</strong> 
	originally thought it was actually the same plane as the Astral transitive plane).
	</p>
	<p>The Astraline Plane is a very strange universe where everything, including 
	the suns, planets and people appear to natives of <strong class="mystarared">
	Mystara</strong> as two-dimensional cardboard cut-outs. Few native creatures 
	live there but it stands between the Prime Plane and Inner Planes and all the 
	Outer Planes in the <strong class="mystarared">Mystaran Multiverse</strong>. 
	As such the Astraline Plane serves as the key stepping stone that all planar 
	travelers must pass through on their way to more distant planes. </p>
	<p>Because of its central position with respect to planar travel in the
	<strong class="mystarared">Mystaran Multiverse</strong> the Astraline Plane 
	is the assumed starting point in the planar addressing scheme used by
	<strong class="mystarared">Mystaran</strong> characters and Immortals to refer 
	to the, frequently complicated, path of planes that must be taken to reach any 
	other known plane. For example, the planar address for the Prime Plane is &quot;Ethereal-Prime&quot;, 
	since one must travel from the Astraline through the Ethereal to reach the Prime.&nbsp; 
	Similarly, the address to the outer plane known as Old Alphatia is &quot;Draesdan-Old 
	Alphatia&quot;, since one must travel from the Astraline through Draesdan to reach 
	Old Alphatia. </p>
	<h4><a name="OuterPlanes" id="OuterPlanes"></a>Outer Planes </h4>
	<p class="initial">The Outer Planes is the name that refers, collectively, to 
	all planes that exist beyond the Astraline Plane. These planes are often home 
	to the Immortals or other creatures such as celestials, demons, and devils.
	</p>
	<p>Many Outer Planes have an alignment, representing a particular moral or ethical 
	outlook, and also a sphere bias, representing the sphere of power (of which 
	there are five - Energy, Matter, Thought, Time and Entropy) with the greatest 
	influence on that plane and its inhabitants. The natives of each plane tend 
	to behave in agreement with that plane?s alignment and may also favor the dominant 
	sphere of power. </p>
	<p>There are countless Outer Planes in the <strong class="mystarared">Mystaran 
	Multiverse</strong>, all of different shapes and sizes. While many are coexistent 
	or coterminous with the Astraline Plane (and can thus be accessed from it directly), 
	there are infinitely many more which are not even coterminous with the Astraline 
	Plane and, sometimes, a given plane may require passage through a very long 
	sequence of Outer Planes to be reached.&nbsp; Still others may not even be directly 
	accessible from any other Outer Plane, and only a Gate spell directed to an 
	Immortal already on that plane would be capable of providing someone with access.
	</p>
	<h4><a name="Demiplanes" id="Demiplanes"></a>Demiplanes </h4>
	<p class="initial">This catch-all category covers all extra-dimensional spaces 
	that function like planes but have measurable size and limited access. The other 
	kinds of planes are theoretically infinite in size, but a demiplane might be 
	only a few hundred feet across. </p>
	<h4><a name="Nodes" id="Nodes"></a>Nodes </h4>
	<p class="initial">Weak spots between two adjoining planes are known variously 
	as proximity nodes, planar nodes or, most often, simply nodes. Travel between 
	planes is usually easier at such nodes and many spells make use of them. All 
	portals occur at nodes but not all nodes are open portals. </p>
	<p>A special form of node, called a dimensional node, represents a weak spot 
	through the Shadow Plane that links a plane in the
	<strong class="mystarared">Mystaran Multiverse</strong> dimension with a plane 
	in an alternate dimension. Such dimensional nodes are usually only found on 
	the most distant and dangerous Outer Planes. A suitable spell cast in the vicinity 
	of a dimensional node may open up a conduit through the Shadow Plane to the 
	alternate dimension. </p>
	<p>Unless a traveler were to stumble across an existing conduit while traveling 
	the Shadow Plane (an almost unheard of occurrence) finding a dimensional node 
	is the only known way to travel from the <strong class="mystarared">Mystaran 
	Multiverse</strong> to other dimensions.<br clear="all" />

<!--webbot bot="Include" i-checksum="15838" endspan -->ach 
	plane of existence has its own properties?the natural laws of its universe. 
	Planar traits are broken down into a number of general areas. All planes have 
	the following kinds of traits.<br clear="all" />
&nbsp; </p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Physical Traits</strong>: These traits determine the laws of 
		physics and nature on the plane, including how gravity and time function.
		</li>
		<li><strong>Elemental and Energy Traits</strong>: These traits determine 
		the dominance of particular elemental or energy forces. </li>
		<li><strong>Alignment Traits</strong>: Just as characters may be lawful 
		neutral or chaotic good, many planes are tied to a particular moral or ethical 
		outlook. </li>
		<li><strong>Magic Traits</strong>: Magic works differently from plane to 
		plane, and magic traits set the boundaries for what it can and can?t do.
		</li>
		<li><strong>Sphere Bias Traits</strong>: These traits determine which of 
		the five <em>Spheres of Power</em>: <em>Matter</em>, <em>Energy</em>,
		<em>Time</em>, <em>Thought</em> and <em>Entropy</em>, if any, has the greatest 
		amount of influence on the plane and its inhabitants. </li>
	</ul>
	<h4 class="stb"><a name="PhysicalTraits" id="PhysicalTraits"></a>Physical Traits </h4>
	<p class="initial">The two most important natural laws set by physical traits 
	are how gravity works and how time passes. Other physical traits pertain to 
	the size and shape of a plane and how easily a plane?s nature can be altered.
	</p>
	<h5><a name="GravityTrait" id="GravityTrait"></a>Gravity </h5>
	<p class="initial">The direction of gravity?s pull may be unusual, and it might 
	even change directions within the plane itself. </p>
	<p class="reference"><em>Normal Gravity</em>:<br />
	Most planes have gravity similar to that of the Material Plane. The usual rules 
	for ability scores, carrying capacity, and encumbrance apply. Unless otherwise 
	noted in a description, it is assumed every plane has the normal gravity trait.
	</p>
	<p class="reference"><em>Heavy Gravity</em>:<br />
	The gravity on a plane with this trait is much more intense than on the Material 
	Plane. As a result, Balance, Climb, Jump, Ride, Swim, and Tumble checks incur 
	a ?2 circumstance penalty, as do all attack rolls. All item weights are effectively 
	doubled, which might affect a character?s speed. Weapon ranges are halved. A 
	character?s Strength and Dexterity scores are not affected. Characters who fall 
	on a heavy gravity plane take 1d10 points of damage for each 10 feet fallen, 
	to a maximum of 20d10 points of damage. </p>
	<p class="reference"><em>Light Gravity</em>:<br />
	The gravity on a plane with this trait is less intense than on the Material 
	Plane. As a result, creatures find that they can lift more, but their movements 
	tend to be ungainly. Characters on a plane with the light gravity trait take 
	a ?2 circumstance penalty on attack rolls and Balance, Ride, Swim, and Tumble 
	checks. All items weigh half as much. Weapon ranges double, and characters gain 
	a +2 circumstance bonus on Climb and Jump checks. </p>
	<p class="reference-continued">Strength and Dexterity don?t change as a result 
	of light gravity, but what you can do with such scores does change. These advantages 
	apply to travelers from other planes as well as natives. </p>
	<p class="reference-continued">Falling characters on a light gravity plane take 
	1d4 points of damage for each 10 feet of the fall (maximum 20d4). </p>
	<p class="reference"><em>No Gravity</em>:<br />
	Individuals on a plane with this trait merely float in space, unless other resources 
	are available to provide a direction for gravity?s pull. </p>
	<p class="reference"><em>Objective Directional Gravity</em>:<br />
	The strength of gravity on a plane with this trait is the same as on the Material 
	Plane, but the direction is not the traditional ?down? toward the ground. It 
	may be down toward any solid object, at an angle to the surface of the plane 
	itself, or even upward. </p>
	<p class="reference-continued">In addition, objective directional gravity may 
	change from place to place. The direction of ?down? may vary. </p>
	<p class="reference"><em>Subjective Directional Gravity</em>:<br />
	The strength of gravity on a plane with this trait is the same as on the Material 
	Plane, but each individual chooses the direction of gravity?s pull. Such a plane 
	has no gravity for unattended objects and nonsentient creatures. This sort of 
	environment can be very disorienting to the newcomer, but is common on ?weightless? 
	planes. </p>
	<p class="reference-continued">Characters on a plane with subjective directional 
	gravity can move normally along a solid surface by imagining ?down? near their 
	feet. If suspended in midair, a character ?flies? by merely choosing a ?down? 
	direction and ?falling? that way. Under such a procedure, an individual ?falls? 
	150 feet in the first round and 300 feet in each succeeding round. Movement 
	is straight-line only. In order to stop, one has to slow one?s movement by changing 
	the designated ?down? direction (again, moving 150 feet in the new direction 
	in the first round and 300 feet per round thereafter). </p>
	<p class="reference-continued">It takes a DC 16 Wisdom check to set a new direction 
	of gravity as a free action; this check can be made once per round. Any character 
	who fails this Wisdom check in successive rounds receives a +6 bonus on subsequent 
	checks until he or she succeeds. </p>
	<h5><a name="TimeTrait" id="TimeTrait"></a>Time </h5>
	<p class="initial">The rate of time?s passage can vary on different planes, 
	though it remains constant within any particular plane. Time is always subjective 
	for the viewer. The same subjectivity applies to various planes. Travelers may 
	discover that they?ll pick up or lose time while moving among the planes, but 
	from their point of view, time always passes naturally. </p>
	<p class="reference"><em>Normal Time</em>:<br />
	This trait describes the way time passes on the Material Plane. One hour on 
	a plane with normal time equals one hour on the Material Plane. Unless otherwise 
	noted in a description, every plane has the normal time trait. </p>
	<p class="reference"><em>Timeless</em>:<br />
	On planes with this trait, time still passes, but the effects of time are diminished. 
	How the timeless trait can affect certain activities or conditions such as hunger, 
	thirst, aging, the effects of poison, and healing varies from plane to plane.<br />
	The danger of a timeless plane is that once one leaves such a plane for one 
	where time flows normally, conditions such as hunger and aging do occur retroactively.
	</p>
	<p class="reference"><em>Flowing Time</em>:<br />
	On some planes, time can flow faster or slower. One may travel to another plane, 
	spend a year there, then return to the Material Plane to find that only six 
	seconds have elapsed. Everything on the plane returned to is only a few seconds 
	older. But for that traveler and the items, spells, and effects working on him, 
	that year away was entirely real.<br />
	When designating how time works on planes with flowing time, put the Material 
	Plane?s flow of time first, followed by the same flow in the other plane.
	</p>
	<p class="reference"><em>Erratic Time</em>:<br />
	Some planes have time that slows down and speeds up, so an individual may lose 
	or gain time as he moves between the two planes. The following is provided as 
	an example.<br />
	</p>
	<div class="align-center">
<table id="tableErraticTime" style="WIDTH: 80%">

	</div>
	<p class="reference-continued">To the denizens of such a plane, time flows naturally 
	and the shift is unnoticed.<br />
	If a plane is timeless with respect to magic, any spell cast with a noninstantaneous 
	duration is permanent until dispelled. </p>
	<h5><a name="ShapeAndSizeTrait" id="ShapeAndSizeTrait"></a>Shape and Size </h5>
	<p class="initial">Planes come in a variety of sizes and shapes. Most planes 
	are infinite, or at least so large that they may as well be infinite.<br />
	</p>
	<p class="reference"><em>Infinite</em>:<br />
	Planes with this trait go on forever, though they may have finite components 
	within them. Or they may consist of ongoing expanses in two directions, like 
	a map that stretches out infinitely.<br />
	</p>
	<p class="reference"><em>Finite Shape</em>:<br />
	A plane with this trait has defined edges or borders. These borders may adjoin 
	other planes or hard, finite borders such as the edge of the world or a great 
	wall. Demiplanes are often finite.<br />
	</p>
	<p class="reference"><em>Self-Contained Shape</em>:<br />
	On planes with this trait, the borders wrap in on themselves, depositing the 
	traveler on the other side of the map. A spherical plane is an example of a 
	self-contained, finite plane, but there can be cubes, toruses, and flat planes 
	with magical edges that teleport the traveler to an opposite edge when he crosses 
	them. </p>
	<p class="reference-continued">Most demiplanes are self-contained. </p>
	<h5><a name="MorphicTrait" id="MorphicTrait"></a>Morphic Traits </h5>
	<p class="initial">This trait measures how easily the basic nature of a plane 
	can be changed. Some planes are responsive to sentient thought, while others 
	can be manipulated only by extremely powerful creatures. And some planes respond 
	to physical or magical efforts.<br />
	</p>
	<p class="reference"><em>Alterable Morphic</em>:<br />
	On a plane with this trait, objects remain where they are (and what they are) 
	unless affected by physical force or magic. You can change the immediate environment 
	as a result of tangible effort. </p>
	<p class="reference"><em>Highly Morphic</em>:<br />
	On a plane with this trait, features of the plane change so frequently that 
	it?s difficult to keep a particular area stable. Such planes may react dramatically 
	to specific spells, sentient thought, or the force of will. Others change for 
	no reason. </p>
	<p class="reference"><em>Magically Morphic</em>:<br />
	Specific spells can alter the basic material of a plane with this trait.<br />
	</p>
	<p class="reference"><em>Divinely Morphic</em>:<br />
	Specific unique beings (Immortals or similar great powers) have the ability 
	to alter objects, creatures, and the landscape on planes with this trait. Ordinary 
	characters find these planes similar to alterable planes in that they may be 
	affected by spells and physical effort. But the deities may cause these areas 
	to change instantly and dramatically, creating great kingdoms for themselves.
	</p>
	<p class="reference"><em>Static</em>:<br />
	These planes are unchanging. Visitors cannot affect living residents of the 
	plane, nor objects that the denizens possess. Any spells that would affect those 
	on the plane have no effect unless the plane?s static trait is somehow removed 
	or suppressed. Spells cast before entering a plane with the static trait remain 
	in effect, however.<br />
	</p>
	<p class="reference-continued">Even moving an unattended object within a static 
	plane requires a DC 16 Strength check. Particularly heavy objects may be impossible 
	to move.<br />
	</p>
	<p class="reference"><em>Sentient</em>:<br />
	These planes are ones that respond to a single thought? that of the plane itself. 
	Travelers would find the plane?s landscape changing as a result of what the 
	plane thought of the travelers, either becoming more or less hospitable depending 
	on its reaction. </p>

	<h4 class="stb">
	<a name="ElementalAndEnergyTraits" id="ElementalAndEnergyTraits"></a>Elemental and Energy 
	Traits </h4>
	<p class="initial">Four basic elements and two types of energy together make 
	up everything. The elements are earth, air, fire, and water. The types of energy 
	are positive and negative. </p>
	<p>The Material Plane reflects a balancing of those elements and energies; all 
	are found there. Each of the Inner Planes is dominated by one element or type 
	of energy. Other planes may show off various aspects of these elemental traits. 
	Many planes have no elemental or energy traits; these traits are noted in a 
	plane?s description only when they are present. </p>
	<p class="reference"><em>Air-Dominant</em>:<br />
	Mostly open space, planes with this trait have just a few bits of floating stone 
	or other elements. They usually have a breathable atmosphere, though such a 
	plane may include clouds of acidic or toxic gas. Creatures of the earth subtype 
	are uncomfortable on air-dominant planes because they have little or no natural 
	earth to connect with. They take no actual damage, however. </p>
	<p class="reference"><em>Earth-Dominant</em>:<br />
	Planes with this trait are mostly solid. Travelers who arrive run the risk of 
	suffocation if they don?t reach a cavern or other pocket within the earth. Worse 
	yet, individuals without the ability to burrow are entombed in the earth and 
	must dig their way out (5 feet per turn). Creatures of the air subtype are uncomfortable 
	on earth dominant planes because these planes are tight and claustrophobic to 
	them. But they suffer no inconvenience beyond having difficulty moving.<br />
	Fire-Dominant: Planes with this trait are composed of flames that continually 
	burn without consuming their fuel source. Fire-dominant planes are extremely 
	hostile to Material Plane creatures, and those without resistance or immunity 
	to fire are soon immolated. </p>
	<p class="reference-continued">Unprotected wood, paper, cloth, and other flammable 
	materials catch fire almost immediately, and those wearing unprotected flammable 
	clothing catch on fire. In addition, individuals take 3d10 points of fire damage 
	every round they are on a fire-dominant plane. Creatures of the water subtype 
	are extremely uncomfortable on fire-dominant planes. Those that are made of 
	water take double damage each round. </p>
	<p class="reference"><em>Water-Dominant</em>:<br />
	Planes with this trait are mostly liquid. Visitors who can?t breathe water or 
	reach a pocket of air will likely drown. Creatures of the fire subtype are extremely 
	uncomfortable on water-dominant planes. Those made of fire take 1d10 points 
	of damage each round. </p>
	<p class="reference"><em>Positive-Dominant</em>:<br />
	An abundance of life characterizes planes with this trait. The two kinds of 
	positive-dominant traits are minor positive-dominant and major positive-dominant. 
	A minor positive-dominant plane is a riotous explosion of life in all its forms. 
	Colors are brighter, fires are hotter, noises are louder, and sensations are 
	more intense as a result of the positive energy swirling through the plane. 
	All individuals in a positive-dominant plane gain fast healing 2 as an extraordinary 
	ability. </p>
	<p class="reference-continued">Major positive-dominant planes go even further. 
	A creature on a major positive-dominant plane must make a DC 15 Fortitude save 
	to avoid being blinded for 10 rounds by the brilliance of the surroundings. 
	Simply being on the plane grants fast healing 5 as an extraordinary ability. 
	In addition, those at full hit points gain 5 additional temporary hit points 
	per round. These temporary hit points fade 1d20 rounds after the creature leaves 
	the major positive- dominant plane. However, a creature must make a DC 20 Fortitude 
	save each round that its temporary hit points exceed its normal hit point total. 
	Failing the saving throw results in the creature exploding in a riot of energy, 
	killing it. </p>
	<p class="reference"><em>Negative-Dominant</em>:<br />
	Planes with this trait are vast, empty reaches that suck the life out of travelers 
	who cross them. They tend to be lonely, haunted planes, drained of color and 
	filled with winds bearing the soft moans of those who died within them. As with 
	positive-dominant planes, negative-dominant planes can be either minor or major. 
	On minor negative-dominant planes, living creatures take 1d6 points of damage 
	per round. At 0 hit points or lower, they crumble into ash. </p>
	<p class="reference-continued">Major negative-dominant planes are even more 
	severe. Each round, those within must make a DC 25 Fortitude save or gain a 
	negative level. A creature whose negative levels equal its current levels or 
	Hit Dice is slain, becoming a wraith. The death ward spell protects a traveler 
	from the damage and energy drain of a negative-dominant plane. </p>
	<p class="stb"><strong>Back To <a href="#TOP">TOP</a></strong> </p>
	<h4 class="stb"><a name="AlignmentTraits" id="AlignmentTraits"></a>Alignment Traits </h4>
	<p class="initial">Some planes have a predisposition to a certain alignment. 
	Most of the inhabitants of these planes also have the plane?s particular alignment, 
	even powerful creatures such as deities. In addition, creatures of alignments 
	contrary to the plane have a tougher time dealing with its natives and situations.
	</p>
	<p>The alignment trait of a plane affects social interactions there. Characters 
	who follow other alignments than most of the inhabitants do may find life more 
	difficult. </p>
	<p>Alignment traits have multiple components. First are the moral (good or evil) 
	and ethical (lawful or chaotic) components; a plane can have either a moral 
	component, an ethical component, or one of each. Second, the specific alignment 
	trait indicates whether each moral or ethical component is mildly or strongly 
	evident. </p>
	<p class="reference"><em>Good-Aligned/Evil-Aligned</em>:<br />
	These planes have chosen a side in the battle of good versus evil. No plane 
	can be both good-aligned and evil-aligned. </p>
	<p class="reference"><em>Law-Aligned/Chaos-Aligned</em>:<br />
	Law versus chaos is the key struggle for these planes and their residents. No 
	plane can be both law-aligned and chaos-aligned. </p>
	<p>Each part of the moral/ethical alignment trait has a descriptor, either ?mildly? 
	or ?strongly,? to show how powerful the influence of alignment is on the plane.
	</p>
	<p class="reference"><em>Mildly Aligned</em>:<br />
	Creatures who have an alignment opposite that of a mildly aligned plane take 
	a ?2 circumstance penalty on all Charisma-based checks. </p>
	<p class="reference"><em>Strongly Aligned</em>: On planes that are strongly 
	aligned, a ?2 circumstance penalty applies on all Charisma-based checks made 
	by all creatures not of the plane?s alignment. In addition, the ?2 penalty affects 
	all Intelligence-based and Wisdom-based checks, too. </p>
	<p>The penalties for the moral and ethical components of the alignment trait 
	do stack. </p>
	<p class="reference"><em>Neutral-Aligned</em>: A mildly neutral-aligned plane 
	does not apply a circumstance penalty to anyone. </p>
	<p class="reference-continued">The Material Plane is considered mildly neutral-aligned, 
	though it may contain high concentrations of evil or good, law or chaos in places.
	</p>
	<p class="reference-continued">A strongly neutral-aligned plane would stand 
	in opposition to all other moral and ethical principles: good, evil, law, and 
	chaos. Such a plane may be more concerned with the balance of the alignments 
	than with accommodating and accepting alternate points of view. In the same 
	fashion as for other strongly aligned planes, strongly neutral-aligned planes 
	apply a ?2 circumstance penalty to Intelligence-, Wisdom-, or Charisma-based 
	checks by any creature that isn?t neutral. The penalty is applied twice (once 
	for law/chaos, and once for good/evil), so neutral good, neutral evil, lawful 
	neutral, and chaotic neutral creatures take a ?2 penalty and lawful good, chaotic 
	good, chaotic evil, and lawful evil creatures take a ?4 penalty. </p>
	<p class="stb"><strong>Back To <a href="#TOP">TOP</a></strong> </p>
	<h4 class="stb"><a name="MagicTraits" id="MagicTraits"></a>Magic Traits </h4>
	<p class="initial">A plane?s magic trait describes how magic works on the plane 
	compared to how it works on the Material Plane. Particular locations on a plane

	On a plane with the wild magic trait spells and spell-like abilities function 
	in radically different and sometimes dangerous ways. Any spell or spell-like 
	ability used on a wild magic plane has a chance to go awry. The caster must 
	make a level check (DC 15 + the level of the spell or effect) for the magic 
	to function normally. For spell-like abilities, use the level or HD of the creature 
	employing the ability for the caster level check and the level of the spell-like 
	ability to set the DC for the caster level check. Failure on this check means 
	that something strange happens; roll d% and consult the table provided with 
	the description of the Plane.&nbsp; If no table is given, use the following

	<h4 class="stb"><a name="SphereBiasTraits" id="SphereBiasTraits"></a>Sphere Bias Traits </h4>
	<h5><a name="SpheresOfPower" id="SpheresOfPower"></a>The Spheres of Power </h5>
	<p class="initial">All planes in the <strong class="mystarared">Mystaran Multiverse</strong> 
	are made up of the five <em>Spheres or Power</em>: Energy, Matter, Thought, 
	Time and Entropy.&nbsp; These are the purest sources of raw power and the most 
	essential ingredients in the <strong class="mystarared">Mystaran Multiverse</strong>.&nbsp; 
	Every plane has a composition that includes all five <em>Spheres of Power</em> 
	but the balance between them is different on each plane. Planes with a higher 
	proportion of Energy tend to be more magical than those with a greater proportion 
	of Matter, planes with a large proportion of Time are more orderly than those 
	with a large proportion of Thought. Any area in which Entropy is dominant soon 
	crumbles into decay. </p>
	<p>The <a href="immortals.html">Immortals</a> of <strong class="mystarared">Mystara</strong> 
	all serve one of the <em>Sphere of Power</em> and all strive to increase the 
	influence that their own Sphere holds within the <strong class="mystarared">
	Mystaran Multiverse</strong> at the expense of all the others. However, if one 
	sphere were actually allowed to gain a significant advantage over the others 
	the resulting imbalance could lead to the destruction of the
	<strong class="mystarared">Mystaran Multiverse</strong> as it currently exists.&nbsp; 
	Thus, most Immortals recognize the need for the continued existence of all the 
	other spheres and will act to ensure that such a critical imbalance never occurs.
	</p>
	<h5><a name="SphereBias" id="SphereBias"></a>Sphere Bias </h5>
	<p class="initial">When the five <em>Spheres of Power</em> are blended in a 
	way such that the essence of a particular plane contains a greater proportion 
	of one Sphere than the others, that plane is said to have a sphere bias trait. 
	A sphere bias may either be mild or strong, depending on how much greater the 
	proportion of the one Sphere is compared to all the others.&nbsp; The Prime 
	Plane is the only known plane in the <strong class="mystarared">Mystaran Multiverse</strong> 
	in which all five Spheres are equally balanced and which, therefore, has no 
	sphere bias trait. </p>
	<p>There are five possible sphere bias traits, one for each <em>Sphere of Power</em>:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Matter-biased</strong>: Planes that are biased toward Matter 
		often have the Earth-dominant and Law-aligned traits, particularly when 
		strongly-biased. They tend to be resistant to change and decay and may also 
		have the Timeless and Static traits. The Outer Plane of Brynn and the Elemental 
		Plane of Earth are examples of planes that are Matter-biased. </li>
		<li><strong>Time-biased</strong>: Planes that are biased toward Time often 
		have the Water-dominant and Neutral-aligned traits, particularly when strongly-biased. 
		They tend to be quite orderly, often have Erratic rather than Normal Time 
		and never exhibit the Timeless trait. The Outer Plane of Entrem and the 
		Elemental Plane of Water are examples of planes that are Time-biased.
		</li>
		<li><strong>Energy-biased</strong>: Planes that are biased toward Energy 
		often have the Fire-dominant and Chaos-aligned traits, particularly when 
		strongly-biased. These planes are often very magical in nature as well as 
		Highly Morphic. Time tends to flow faster than normal for such planes. The 
		Outer Plane of Draesten and the Elemental Plane of Fire are examples of 
		planes that are Energy-biased. </li>
		<li><strong>Thought-biased</strong>: Planes that are biased toward Thought 
		often have the Air-dominant trait, particularly when strongly-biased. They 
		may also have the Good-aligned trait, although this association is not as 
		strong as with some of the other sphere/alignment associations. The Outer 
		Plane of Mirage and the Elemental Plane of Air are examples of planes that 
		are Thought-biased. </li>
		<li><strong>Entropy-biased</strong>: Planes that are biased toward Entropy 
		often have the Negative-dominant trait, particularly when strongly-biased. 
		They may also have the Evil-aligned trait, although this association is 
		not as strong as with some of the other sphere/alignment associations. Time 
		often flows more slowly on such planes. The Outer Plane of Pyts and the 
		Negative Energy Plane are examples of planes that are Entropy-biased.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h5>Sphere Interactions </h5>
	<p class="initial">Each Sphere interacts with the other Spheres in accordance 
	with the principles of Dominance and Opposition. </p>
	<p>A Dominant Sphere tends to consume the essence of the dominated Sphere, deriving 
	greater power at the expense of the other in the process.&nbsp; This has the 
	greatest effect on spellcasting and spells with a
	<a href="#SphereSubtypeAndDescriptors">sphere descriptor</a> may be Enhanced 
	or Impeded. </p>
	<p class="reference"><em>Mildly-biased</em>:<br />

	plane.. </p>
	<p class="reference"><em>Strongly-biased</em>:<br />
	Spells with a sphere descriptor that is dominated by that of a strongly-biased 
	plane are Impeded.&nbsp; Spells with a sphere descriptor that dominates that 
	of a strongly-biased plane are Enhanced by the Heighten Spell feat.&nbsp; Spells 
	with a sphere descriptor that is the same as that of a strongly-biased plane 
	are Enhanced in two or more metamagic feats.&nbsp; Spells without a sphere descriptor 
	or with a sphere descriptor that does not dominate, is not dominated and is 
	not the same as that of a strongly-biased plane are not affected by the Principle 
	of Dominance </p>
	<p>Each of the five <em>Spheres of Power</em> dominates exactly one other sphere, 
	as follows: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Matter <strong>dominates</strong> Thought </li>
		<li>Thought <strong>dominates</strong> Time </li>
		<li>Time <strong>dominates</strong> Energy </li>

	Plane cannot attack creatures on a coexistent plane, and vice versa. A traveler 
	on the Ethereal Plane is invisible, incorporeal, and utterly silent to someone 
	on a coexistent plane. </p>
	<p>The Ethereal Plane is mostly empty of structures and impediments. However, 
	the plane has its own inhabitants. Some of these are other ethereal travelers, 
	but the ghosts found here pose a particular peril to those who walk the fog.
	</p>
	<h5><a name="EtherealTraits" id="EtherealTraits"></a>Ethereal Plane Traits </h5>
	<p>The <strong class="mystarared">Mystaran</strong> Ethereal Plane is very similar 
	to the standard Ethereal Plane as described in <cite>The d20 System Reference 
	Document</cite> [<a href="lore.html#d20-SRD">d20-SRD</a>]. It has the following 
	traits: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Planar Address: Ethereal (that is, it is adjacent to the Astraline)
		</li>
		<li>No gravity </li>
		<li>Infinite size.&nbsp; The Ethereal is always infinite or finite depending 
		on the plane or planes it is adjacent to. As the
		<strong class="mystarared">Mystaran</strong> Ethereal is always adjacent 
		to an infinite plane, it is technically also infinite. </li>
		<li>Alterable morphic.&nbsp; The plane contains little to alter, however
		</li>
		<li>No Elemental or Energy Traits (specific locations may have these traits, 
		however) </li>
		<li>Mildly neutral-aligned </li>
		<li>Normal magic. Spells function normally on the Ethereal Plane, though 
		even when in a region that is coexistent with another plane, they do not 
		cross into that plane. </li>
		<li>No Sphere Bias Traits (specific locations may have these traits, however)
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Regarding magic, spells and spell-like abilities that have the force descriptor 
	and abjuration spells that affect ethereal beings can cross into the Ethereal 
	from a coexistent plane. Spellcasters on a coexistent plane must have some way 
	to detect foes on the Ethereal Plane before targeting them with force-based 
	spells, of course. While it is possible to hit ethereal enemies with a force 
	spell cast on a coexistent plane, the reverse still isn't possible. As stated 
	above, no magical attacks cross from the Ethereal Plane to a coexistent plane, 
	including force attacks. </p>

		<h4>The Spirit World </h4>
		<p class="initial">There is a hard-to-find region in the Deep Ethereal of 
		the <strong class="mystarared">Mystaran Multiverse</strong> which is home 
		to a race of spirit creatures. This region is the <em>Spirit World</em>, 
		which is described in the <cite>The Golden Khan of Ethengar</cite> Gazetteer 
		[<a href="lore.html#GAZ12">GAZ 12</a>]. The Spirit World can usually only 
		be found with the help of a spirit guide or use of the <em>spirit walk</em> 
		spell. </p>
		<p>Upon entering the <em>Spirit World</em> the traveler is surrounded by 
		a white mist but this mist soon clears to reveal many different types of 
		terrain: deserts, cities, frozen ice fields, steppes, jungles, fields of 
		lava and fire... This terrain is an illusion growing out of the traveler's 
		own mind or possibly placed there by the spirits themselves. </p>
		<p>A permanent <em>gate</em> to the <em>Spirit World</em> is located in 
		the Sea of Black Sand in the Ethengar Khanates.&nbsp; It was created by 
		a cataclysmic event that shook <strong class="mystarared">Mystara</strong> 
		in the dawn of its history. </p>

	<p>*Curtains tend to have a color based on the Sphere Bias of the plane to which 
	they lead: pink for Energy, tan for Matter, light blue for Thought, light Green 
	for Time and gray for Entropy. Strong biases lead to deeper colors but there 
	are always variations in texture and appearance which help to distinguish between 
	different planes with the same bias.</p>

	<h4 class="stb"><a name="ShadowPlane" id="ShadowPlane"></a>The Plane of Shadow</h4>
	<p class="initial">The Plane of Shadow is a transitive plane made up of sub-regions 
	that are each coexistent with another plane in the
	<strong class="mystarared">Mystaran Multiverse</strong>. It is a world of black 
	and white that looks like a photographic negative of the terrain from the coexistent 
	plane. Each region connects to a deeper part of the Shadow Plane called the 
	Deep Shadow and beyond the Deep Shadow lies an infinite number of alternate 
	dimensions.&nbsp; In theory, with the right spell cast in the right location, 
	a character could use the Plane of Shadow to visit other realities. </p>

		<h4>Shadows of other Planes </h4>
		<p class="initial">The <strong class="mystarared">Mystaran</strong> Shadow 
		Plane uses a version of the &quot;Shadows of Other Planes&quot; option mentioned in 
		the <cite>Manual of the Planes</cite> [<a href="lore.html#MotP">MotP</a>].&nbsp; 
		The plane is split into separate regions, each one coexistent with a different 
		plane (there is a shadow region coexistent with every plane in the
		<strong class="mystarared">Mystaran Multiverse</strong> except the Astral 
		Plane). Wherever two planes are coterminous the regions of the shadow coexistent 
		with those planes are also coterminous.</p>
		<h4>Deep Shadow and Alternate Dimensions</h4>
		<p class="initial">In a manner similar to the Deep Ethereal of the<br />
		Ethereal Plane, each region of the Shadow Plane is connected to every other 
		region through an area called the Deep Shadow. This is the area of extreme 
		terrain that the <cite>Manual of the Planes</cite> [<a href="lore.html#MotP">MotP</a>] 
		refers to when describing how a planar travel might locate the Material 
		Plane of an alternate dimension.</p>
		<p>Alternate Material Planes do exist beyond the Deep Shadow but it is not 
		possible to reach them in the same manner described in the <cite>Manual 
		of the Planes</cite> [<a href="lore.html#MotP">MotP</a>]. Instead, alternate 
		dimensions can only be accessed through a dimensional node - a weak spot 
		between the dimensions.&nbsp; Dimensional nodes are usually located on the 
		most distant and dangerous Outer Planes where the laws of the
		<strong class="mystarared">Mystaran Multiverse</strong> begin to break down.</p>
		<p>With the right spell cast by a dimensional node, a conduit that tunnels 
		through the Plane of Shadow may be created that allows access from the
		<strong class="mystarared">Mystaran Multiverse</strong> to another dimension. 
		Although it is theoretically possible to run into such a conduit through 
		random exploration, such an occurrence would be extremely rare and could 
		only occur in the Deep Shadow or in a region bordering the plane from which 
		the conduit originates.</p>
		<a name="endSpiritWorldSidebar0" id="endSpiritWorldSidebar0"></a></div>
	<p>The Plane of Shadow is magically morphic, and parts continually flow onto 
	other planes. As a result, creating a precise map of the plane is next to impossible, 
	despite the presence of landmarks.</p>
	<p>The Plane of Shadow is coexistent with every plane in the
	<strong class="mystarared">Mystaran Multiverse</strong> except the Astral Plane. 
	Knowledgeable planar travelers can use the Plane of Shadow to cover great distances 
	on a coexistent plane very quickly.&nbsp; Spells like <em>Plane Shift</em> and
	<em>Travel</em> use the Shadow Plane to form conduits between the planes, however 
	these spells can not access the Deep Shadow and thus restrict planar travelers 
	to movement between coterminous regions only. For this reason, most planar travel 
	in <strong class="mystarared">Mystara</strong> is accomplished one plane at 
	a time, in accordance with the <strong class="mystarared">Mystaran</strong>
	<a href="#PlanarAddressing">planar addressing scheme</a>.</p>
	<h5><a name="ShadowTraits" id="ShadowTraits"></a>Plane of Shadow Traits </h5>
	<p>The <strong class="mystarared">Mystaran</strong> Plane of Shadow is very 
	similar to the standard Plane of Shadow as described in <cite>The d20 System 
	Reference Documentt</cite> [<a href="lore.html#d20-SRD">d20-SRD</a>]. It has 
	the following traits: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Planar Address: Plane of Shadow (that is, it is adjacent to the Astraline)
		</li>
		<li>Normal gravity </li>
		<li>Infinite size.&nbsp; Technically, each region of the Plane of Shadow 
		is technically infinite or finite depending on the plane it is adjacent 
		to.&nbsp; The Deep Shadow is infinite. </li>
		<li>Magically morphic.&nbsp; Certain spells modify the base material of 
		the Plane of Shadow. The utility and power of these spells within the Plane 
		of Shadow make them particularly useful for explorers and natives alike.
		</li>
		<li>No Elemental or Energy Traits (however, this may vary depending on bordering 
		plane) </li>
		<li>Mildly neutral-aligned (however, this may vary depending on bordering 
		plane)</li>
		<li>Enhanced magic. Spells with the shadow descriptor are enhanced on the 
		Plane of Shadow. Such spells are cast as though they were prepared with 
		the Maximize Spell feat, though they don&#39;t require the higher spell slots. 
		Furthermore, specific spells become more powerful on the Plane of Shadow. 
		Shadow conjuration and shadow evocation spells are 30% as powerful as the 
		conjurations and evocations they mimic (as opposed to 20%). Greater shadow 
		conjuration and greater shadow evocation are 70% as powerful (not 60%), 
		and a shades spell conjures at 90% of the power of the original (not 80%).</li>
		<li>Impeded magic. Spells that use or generate light or fire may fizzle 
		when cast on the Plane of Shadow. A spellcaster attempting a spell with 
		the light or fire descriptor must succeed on a Spellcraft check (DC 20 + 
		the level of the spell). Spells that produce light are less effective in 
		general, because all light sources have their ranges halved on the Plane 
		of Shadow. Despite the dark nature of the Plane of Shadow, spells that produce, 
		use, or manipulate darkness are unaffected by the plane. </li>
		<li>Mildly Entropy-biased </li>
	</ul>
	<h5>Shadow Portals</h5>
	<p class="initial">Portals from the Plane of Shadow to other planes are mainly 
	found along the border regions where the Plane of Shadow region coexistent with 
	one plane is coterminous with the Plane of Shadow region coexistent with another 
	plane.&nbsp; However, these portals only go to the planes along that border.</p>
	<p>The only other portals on the Plane of Shadow are found in the Darklands 
	regions of the Deep Shadow and lead to the Negative Energy Plane. There are 
	no portals leading from the Plane of Shadow to the Astral Plane as these two 
	planes are neither coexistent nor coterminous in the
	<strong class="mystarared">Mystaran Multiverse</strong>. </p>
	<p>For these reasons, travelers on the Shadow Plane are forced to access planes 
	one plane at a time, in accordance with the <strong class="mystarared">Mystaran</strong>
	<a href="#PlanarAddressing">planar addressing scheme</a>. It takes 1d4 hours 
	of constant travel to find a random portal. </p>
