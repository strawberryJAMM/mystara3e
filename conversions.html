	any existing 0E D&amp;D Character into a 3E D&amp;D character compatible with a

			<a title="Skip past the sidebar to the content." accesskey="S" href="#endConsiderSidebar"><u>S</u>kip over sidebar</a>.</div>
		<h4>Things to Consider Before Converting Your Character</h4>
		<p class="initial">Before you start converting a 
		<strong class="mystarared">Mystaran</strong> character 
		using the following steps, you might want to keep 
		the following facts in mind:</p>
		<ol type="a">
			<li>The primary audience for these guidelines is the DM who is seeking to convert 0E NPCs 
			into 3E format</li>
			<li>The focus was on simplicity and ease of use and not on 
			conversion flexibility.</li>
			<li>Except for the process of calculating 3E character level, these 
			steps are intended to be general guidelines and are in no way intended 
			to represent the only way 
			a 0E character could be converted into 3E and still fit within the context 
			of a <strong class="mystarared">Mystara-3E</strong> campaign. </li>
		</ol>
		<p>Players with pre-existing 0E PCs may want to refer to this process as 
		their PCs are converted, but we encourage them (and their DMs) to consider 
		options outside of these guidelines, especially with respect to prestige 
		classes and possible multiclassing opportunities, based on the PC&#39;s history and general 
		character concept.</p>
		<p>DMs should also consider whether any NPC they are about to convert 
		is a strategic NPC.&nbsp; This process works best for secondary 
		NPCs&#8212;the ones who are there to fill out the population of the town or the 
		staff of the manor, and who the PCs may interact with to obtain useful (or 
		misleading) information, but that are not absolutely essential to the 
		adventure.&nbsp; Strategic 
		NPCs&#8212;the primary villains and/or victims without whom there would be no 
		adventure&#8212;will still convert into a reasonable 3E character version using these 
		guidelines, 
		but may often benefit from being treated like PCs and converted 
		with a more flexible mindset.</p>

	<h3><a name="Step1-3ERace" id="Step1-3ERace"></a>Step 1: Review 
	Mystara-3E Race Details</h3>
	<p class="initial">The first step in the conversion process is to ensure 
	that you are familiar with the details of the <strong class="mystarared">Mystara-3E</strong> 
	version of the character&#39;s race.&nbsp; The Mystara-3E conversion uses 
	<strong class="mystarared">Mystaran</strong> 
	sub-races for most standard 3E character races and also provides 3E version 
	of races that are unique to the <strong class="mystarared">Mystaran</strong> settings.&nbsp; 
	You can click the following links to access the information for each of the 
	four core races found in 0E D&amp;D sources.&nbsp; Racial information available 
	for additional races can be obtained by visiting the <strong><a href="races.html">
	Races of Mystara</a></strong> page.</p>

	</ul>
	<h3><a name="Step2-3ECharLevel" id="Step2-3ECharLevel"></a>Step 2: Calculate 
	3E Character Level</h3>
	<p class="initial">Because humans in 0E could only advance in a single class 
	and non-human races were treated as if their race was their class, the process 
	to determine your character&#39;s effective 3E character level differ slightly depending 
	on his race.</p>

	<p class="initial">In standard 0E D&amp;D, the <strong><a href="races.html#elves">elf</a></strong> race was able to reach 10th level,

	as they gained experience they continued to improve their abilities by obtaining 
	additional Attack Ranks, lettered from D through M.</p>
	<p>A 0E D&amp;D elf is effectively a multiclass Fighter/Magic User, with both combat and arcane magic 
	skills. This 
	combination of abilities results in a character that is slightly more 
	powerful than other characters at similar levels, starting from first level.</p>
	<p>To accommodate this difference in power, and also to allow converted 
	characters to retain the same, or better, proficiencies with combat and arcane spellcasting, the 
	first level 0E elf is considered to be the equivalent of a 0E human with 2 class 
	levels, with one level each of the Fighter and Wizard classes (see . </p>
	<p>For the remaining numbered levels, 2 through 10/C, the elf&#39;s effective 0E 
	human class level increases by five levels for every four elf class levels.&nbsp; 
	To achieve this, the elf&#39;s effective human class levels are increased by one 
	level for each additional elf level except every fourth additional level, 
	levels 5 and 9, where her effective human class level is increased by two 
	levels.&nbsp; Thus, 
	at 5th-level, the 
	0E elf character is the equivalent of a 0E human with 7 class levels, which 
	is, in turn, the equivalent of a 3E character with 7 character levels; at 8th-level she is the equivalent of a 
	0E human with 10 
	class levels, which is, in turn, the equivalent of a 3E character with 10 
	character levels; and at 10/C-level she is the equivalent 
	of a 0E human with 13 class levels, which is, in turn, the equivalent of a 
	3E character with 13 character levels.</p>
	<p>All elf Attack Ranks, D through M, are equal to two human 
	class levels.&nbsp; Therefore the the 10/D-level 0E elf character is the equivalent of a 
	0E human with 14 class levels, which is, in turn, the equivalent of a 3E 
	character with 14 character levels; and a 10/J-level 0E elf character is the

		<li>A Rake will never knowingly join or work for a Thieves' Guild.</li>
		<li>A Rake will never use his Sneak Attack ability in a lethal 
		manner against an 
		opponent that is not prepared to defend himself.&nbsp; That is, he will never deal 
		lethal Sneak Attack damage against an opponent that is flatfooted.&nbsp; 
		He will, however, quite readily use this ability in any other situation where an 
		opponent is denied his Dexterity bonus to AC, when he has his opponent 
		flanked, or whenever he dealing non-lethal damage with a weapon that 
		does so naturally (such as a sap).</li>
		<li>A Rake will never knowingly use any skill for a dishonest or 
		dishonorable reason.</li>
		<li>[<em>optional</em>] A Rake treats Forgery, Intimidate, and Sleight of Hand&#8224; 
		(skills typically used in &quot;shady&quot; ways) as cross-class skills instead of 
		class skills.

	rank.&nbsp; See Table C5: 0E Elf Character Converted 3E Class Level 
	Progression

	<p>The <strong>Forester</strong> class is a variant class for 0E human characters, 
	introduced in the <cite>Dawn of the Emperors </cite>boxed set [<a href="lore.html#DotE">DotE</a>].&nbsp; 
	This class allowed a human character who had been properly trained by and adopted into the Vyalia clan of wood elves to learn the way of the elf, 
	including many of the secrets and skills typically reserved for the wood elf 
	race. 
	From a game mechanics point of view, human Foresters are identical 
	to elves and must use the same guidelines when determining class levels.</p>

		<p class="initial">&#8224; This conversion generally recommends that 1st-level 
		elves be converted to 2nd character level in 3E.&nbsp; This is to ensure 
		they will have all the necessary proficiencies with magic and combat 
		after conversion. NPCs that are less 
		integral to the plot may optionally be converted to 1st character level at the 
		DM&#39;s discretion and, if they do, we recommend that common 1st level 
		elves be converted as 1st-level Wizards.</p>
		<p>Alternatively any DM who uses the Variant rule for &quot;1st-Level Multiclass 
		Characters&quot; found in the <cite>Dungeon Master&#39;s Guide</cite> [<a href="lore.html#DMG">DMG</a>] may wish to convert 1st-level elves to 1st-level 
		characters by using these rules, resulting in a 0.5/0.5 Ftr/Wiz 
		character, with a primary class of Wizard.</p>
		<p class="initial">&#8225; Although the standard calculation for determining a 0E 
		elf's 
		effective 3E 
		Character Level skips over these 3E character levels (see
		<a href="#Step2Biii-3ECharLevel-Elf">Step 2B.iii: Elf Character Level</a> above) they have 
		been included in this table for the sake of completeness. </p>

		<h4>Alternative Class Conversion Options</h4>
	<p class="initial">In some situations, and for certain classes, it may be worth 
	considering, for flavor or other reasons, deviating 
	from the standard conversion guidelines given above.</p>
		<p>Specifically, you may wish to consider whether any of the following 
		alternate conversions would be appropriate for a particular character:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>When the normal conversion is 3E <strong>Fighter</strong>, consider using 
			a 3E <strong>Barbarian</strong>, <strong>Ranger</strong> 
			or <strong>Warrior</strong> instead.</li>
			<li>When the normal conversion is 3E <strong>Rogue</strong>, consider using a 3E 
			<strong>Ranger</strong> or <strong>Expert</strong> 
			instead.</li>
			<li>When the normal conversion is 3E <strong>Wizard</strong>, consider using a 3E 
			<strong>Bard</strong> or <strong>Sorcerer</strong> 
			instead.</li>
		</ul>
	<p>However, we do advise you to tread carefully before choosing to deviate 
	from our standard conversion recommendations.&nbsp; Consider carefully whether there are 
	any class abilities or a skill levels that the adventure assumes the 
	character in question does or does not have in order to facilitate or justify certain 
	events or elements of the plot.&nbsp; If there are such assumptions, the 
	converted character should be designed to continue meeting these adventure 
	requirements in some way (though not necessarily exactly the same way).</p>
