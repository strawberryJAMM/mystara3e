<!--webbot bot="Include" i-checksum="15906" endspan --><p class="initial">f you are a long time D&amp;D gamer, you may 
    already recognize
  <strong class="mystarared">Mystara</strong> by a different name: <strong><em>The Known World</em></strong>. 
    This was the campaign setting created and developed by TSR Inc. for its 
    original Dungeons and Dragons line, often referred to as BD&amp;D (for &quot;Basic&quot;), 
    OD&amp;D (for &quot;original,&quot; or &quot;old&quot;) or, more recently, as 0E&nbsp;D&amp;D (for &quot;zero 
    edition&quot;). Developed to an incredible level of detail through TSR&#39;s 
    publication of 20+ regional campaign accessories, <strong class="mystarared">Mystara</strong> would eventually include three complete campaign settings, all 
    located on the same planet yet having certain elements that made each 
    distinct in its own right. These three settings are known as <strong><em>The Known 
    World</em></strong>, <strong><em>The Savage Coast</em></strong>, and <strong>
	<em>The Hollow World</em></strong>.</p>
  <p>Collectively, and in the humble opinion of our project team members,
  <strong class="mystarared">Mystara</strong> consists simply of the most well developed, 
  world-spanning fantasy campaign settings that TSR ever produced.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, the <strong class="mystarared">Mystara</strong> line was canceled in 
  the mid 1990&#39;s, just shortly after TSR dropped the 0E D&amp;D line and made a 
  failed attempt to convert it into D&amp;D 2nd Edition rules. Even with this 
  abandonment by its originators, <strong class="mystarared">Mystara</strong> has always 
  maintained a strong presence in the online community. Many fans have spent 
  copious amounts of spare time dedicated to continuing the development of 
  completely new material as well as deliberate expansions on original source 
  material. As a result, <strong class="mystarared">Mystara</strong> has remained alive 
  and well to this day.</p>
  <p>If you are interested in investigation this great wealth of fan developed 
  material, the place to go is our sister site,
  <a href="http://www.pandius.com/" class="offsite">The Vaults of Pandius</a>, 
  which has Wizards of the Coast&#39;s stamp of approval as the &quot;Official Mystara 
  Web Site&quot;.</p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" i-checksum="15974" endspan --><p class="initial"><strong class="mystarared">ystara</strong> is a 
    high-magic, high-fantasy, high-adventure world; not unlike Wizards of the 
    Coast&#39;s officially supported settings of <cite>Greyhawk</cite> and <cite>
    Forgotten Realms</cite>. So, one might ask, why bother with 
	<strong class="mystarared">Mystara</strong> when these other, official settings are available? Well, while 
	<strong class="mystarared">Mystara</strong> may have its roots in fantastic magical adventure, it portrays 
    this theme in its own exciting and unique ways.</p>
  <p>A good campaign setting, as every role-player worth his or her salt knows, 
  has a unique style and theme to it. Pause a moment and think about a few 
  different campaign settings: <cite>Ravenloft</cite>, <cite>Dragonlance</cite>, 
  or 
	<cite>Planescape</cite>. Or for that matter, <cite>Vampire </cite>or <cite>
	Middle Earth Role Playing (MERP)</cite>. Now, try to imagine running a <cite>
  MERP</cite> game featuring Monks and Mind Flayers?&nbsp; A
	<cite>Ravenloft</cite> game run as a dungeon crawl where the party simply 
  slaughters anything that detects as evil?&nbsp; How about a <cite>Star Wars</cite> 
  game with combat so deadly that characters are paranoid and afraid to take any 
  risks?</p>
  <p>While not necessarily <em>impossible</em>, none of these scenarios would 
  qualify as &quot;a typical game&quot; in any of those settings.&nbsp; Each setting has 
  an aura or &quot;flavor&quot; to it, which is what makes it stand out, worthy in its own 
  right. <cite>MERP</cite> is (obviously) Tolkien-esque, and neither Monks nor 
  Mind Flayers fit naturally Tolkien&#39;s world. The <cite>Ravenloft</cite> setting 
  expects that the PC&#39;s will be unsure of those around them, and unable to 
  detect where the <em>real</em> evil is. And swashbuckling, heroic, risk-taking 
  actions are par for the course in a <cite>Star Wars</cite> campaign &mdash; just 
  like in all the movies that inspired it.</p>
  <p>So what makes <strong class="mystarared">Mystara</strong> different from other &quot;high 
  magic, high fantasy, high adventure worlds&quot;, and what sort of adventure can 
  you expect to find there?</p>
  <p class="stb"><strong>Diverse Culture:</strong> <strong class="mystarared">Mystara</strong> 
  comprises a richly detailed tapestry of cultures that exist side-by-side. Want 
  to play a traditional knight in shining armor in a feudal pseudo-European 
  setting? Fancy trying your hand at a Viking berserker or a Roman gladiator? 
  Perhaps you&#39;d prefer to be a renaissance swashbuckler, a horse-warrior Mongol 
  from the arid steppes, or a Native American shaman? Or perhaps you&#39;re fond of 
  the culture of China, or India, or Egypt?</p>
  <p>In <strong class="mystarared">Mystara</strong>, there&#39;s somewhere with something for 
  everyone, no matter what their tastes are.</p>
  <p>Don&#39;t, however, think that this means <strong class="mystarared">Mystara</strong> is 
  just a world of copycat non-originality with incompatible settings forced to 
  exist together. Magic has a way of changing things, making the unlikely 
  perfectly plausible and giving what may seems familiar on the surface enough 
  twists to keep even the most jaded players on their toes. The interaction 
  between these cultures is both natural and often fraught with tension and 
  conflict.</p>
  <p class="stb"><strong class="mystarared"></strong><strong>Order vs. Anarchy:</strong> Unlike most 
  other settings, in <strong class="mystarared">Mystara</strong> &quot;Order&quot; and &quot;Anarchy&quot; are 
  far more often at odds with each other than &quot;Good&quot; and &quot;Evil&quot; necessarily are 
  &mdash; though that&#39;s not to say that Good and Evil never clash.</p>
  <p>But let&#39;s briefly compare the alignment tendencies of 
	<strong class="mystarared">Mystara</strong> against those of the two official campaign settings for the 3E D&amp;D 
  rules: <cite>Greyhawk</cite> and 
	<cite>Forgotten Realms</cite>:</p>
  <dl>
    <dt><cite><strong>Greyhawk:</strong></cite></dt>
    <dd>centers around <strong>Militant Neutrality</strong> &mdash; alignments are seen as 
    undesirable extremes and Evil frequently seems to be on the winning side.</dd>
	<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dt><cite><strong>Forgotten Realms:</strong></cite></dt>
    <dd>has epic, flashy confrontations between <strong>Good and Evil</strong>, and Good 
    is clearly the stronger power.</dd>
	<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dt><cite><strong>Mystara:</strong></cite></dt>
    <dd>focuses on the clash between <strong>Order and Anarchy</strong> rather than Good 
    and Evil, though few wish evil to befall the entire world.</dd>
  </dl>
  <p>Order in <strong class="mystarared">Mystara</strong> is found in the many diverse 
  societies and cultures of <strong class="mystarared">Mystara</strong>: The Plutocratic 
  Republic of Darokin, the Feudal society of Karameikos, the Mercantile Guilds 
  of Minrothad, and the Principalities of Glantri. Usually lawful (and often 
  good &mdash; at least from their own point of view) governing bodies try to keep 
  community and economy strong and stable. But the forces of order are not 
  always good &mdash; such as the Heldannic Knights and their subjugation of the 
  indigenous people of the Heldannic Freeholds &mdash; and may not even be &quot;Lawful&quot;.</p>
  <p>Anarchy, on the other hand, is often found in the form of monster hordes: 
  The Broken Lands, the Orclands in Darokin, the wilds of Karameikos, the Great 
  Crater, the Desert Nomads... outside forces preying upon civilization, usually 
  chaotic (and often evil) in nature. It is also seen in certain elements within 
  society: the factions of Glantri, the treachery in Thyatis, the civil unrest 
  in Karameikos. The forces of anarchy are not always evil, and not even always 
  &quot;Chaotic&quot; (in the 3e sense of the alignment) &mdash; such as the Alfheim refugees 
  who flood the surrounding countries after their homeland was magically laid to 
  waste &mdash; but they are always there. </p>
  <p class="stb"><strong>Good guys vs. the ... Good guys?:</strong> In most major
  <strong class="mystarared">Mystaran</strong> conflicts, it&#39;s hard to separate the good 
  from the bad &mdash; there is rarely one side that is unequivocally &quot;Right&quot; and 
  another that is unequivocally &quot;Wrong&quot;. Sometimes one side is clearly better, 
  but that&#39;s more by accident than design: in a world in conflict, it is bound 
  to happen sooner or later. There are a few classic &quot;bad guy&quot; scenarios, and 
  even in those that do exist it&#39;s not so much &quot;Good&quot; attacking &quot;Evil&quot; out of 
  principle, it&#39;s more like &quot;Evil&quot; attacks a &quot;Neutral victim&quot; (Neutral because 
  they didn&#39;t do anything to stop evil until they were personally attacked by 
  it) and then &quot;Good&quot; responds.</p>
  <p>This is in contrast to the <cite>Forgotten Realms</cite> and <cite>Greyhawk</cite>, 
  where organized societies exist which are devoted to opposing Evil and 
  spreading Good, or, at the very least, to maintaining a balanced Neutrality. 
  These individuals and organizations aggressively crusade against Evil, rather 
  than passively ignore it. But in <strong class="mystarared">Mystara</strong> &mdash; well, 
  the fact is, though we gave it some serious thought, we have not been able to 
  think of even a single example of a Good crusader who attacks Evil out of 
  nothing save sheer principle.</p>
  <p>Additionally, most plots and conflicts in <strong class="mystarared">Mystara</strong> 
  tend to arise from the personal goals and ambitions of all the various 
  parties. At first glance this may not seem any different than other settings; 
  after all, it&#39;s the Evil villain&#39;s plans that put everything in motion. But 
  the difference in <strong class="mystarared">Mystara</strong> is that it&#39;s 
	<em>everyone</em> 
  who has grand ambitions, not just the Evil villains, and these plans don&#39;t 
  always please others. The conflict between Stefan Karameikos and Baron von 
  Ludwig is probably the closest thing to a classic Good vs. Evil plot in
  <strong class="mystarared">Mystara</strong>, but even Stefan made decisions that lead to 
  actions that resulted in significant misery for others. First, he was granted 
  autonomous rule of Traladara &mdash; a subject-nation that hadn&#39;t exactly been 
  happy about being under Thyatian control to begin with &mdash; and immediately 
  invited his fellow Thyatians to help him colonize the country. The Thyatians 
  came in droves and their subsequent land-grabbing actions and contempt for the 
  native Traladarans caused widespread misery and suffering. He also allowed his 
  cousin, Baron von Ludwig, to get away with terrible persecution and tyranny 
  for years simply because he was too naive to believe the reports was hearing 
  which, to him, could only be outrageous exaggerations. He would even abandon 
  his Thyatian allies in their hour of need &mdash; breaking a mutual defense treaty 
  that he had signed with his former homeland when he felt that his young 
  country&#39;s survival could only be guaranteed by forging a deal with Alphatia, 
  Thyatis&#39; enemy. Stephen is certainly good in comparison to von Ludwig but, 
  objectively speaking, he&#39;s a far cry from being good 100% of the time. And 
  yet, he remains one of the shining examples of enlightened goodness in
  <strong class="mystarared">Mystara</strong>. </p>
  <p class="stb">All the above is focused on <strong><cite>The Known World</cite></strong>, 
  the original campaign setting of <strong class="mystarared">Mystara</strong>. Adding 
  even more spice and variety to an already flavorful role-playing meal are the 
  two other campaign settings, <strong><cite>The Savage Coast</cite></strong> and 
	<strong><cite>
  The Hollow World</cite></strong>.</p>
  <p><strong><cite>The Savage Coast</cite></strong> is found to the far west, a long way 
  from where the countries of <strong><cite>The Known World</cite></strong> are nestled in 
  their small corner on the south eastern tip of the continent of Brun. Few 
  merchants and explorers of <strong><cite>The Known World</cite></strong> who travel so 
  far venture past the port of Slagovitch and into the regions beyond and those 
  few that do rarely, if ever, return to their homes. Rumors abound about the 
  region, ranging from stories that claim most people from the region have 
  superhuman abilities that seem like arcane magic but are something else, to 
  the existence of a strange metal, that cannot be mined anywhere else, that is 
  as strong as steel but much lighter and has certain innate magical properties. 
  It is a region full of swashbuckling heroes and strange lands that may just as 
  easily be run by civilized societies of monstrous humanoids, such as the 
  feline Rakasta or the canine Lupin, as by humans or demihumans. It is a place 
  unlike any other you&#39;ve ever seen &mdash; assuming you&#39;re brave enough (or 
  foolhardy enough) to actually go and see it.</p>
  <p><strong><cite>The Hollow World</cite></strong>, in its turn, is something else again. 
  There are very few people on the surface world who are aware of the fact that 
  the planet of <strong class="mystarared">Mystara</strong> is a hollow sphere, and even 
  fewer still who suspect that beneath their very feet rests a whole other world 
  full of nations and cultures that were once found on the surface but have not 
  been seen for centuries and even millennia. Although many of those who hear 
  this tale wave it off as pure nonsense, they would be wrong for, unlike most 
  celestial bodies, the planet of <strong class="mystarared">Mystara</strong> 
	<em>is</em> a 
  hollow sphere. Instead of a hot core of magma, there is open space, and it 
  holds another world on the interior surface of the sphere and upon &quot;floating 
  continents&quot; and &quot;islands&quot; that circle a small red-colored sun located at the 
  exact center of the planet. This world is a museum; a store house of lost 
  cultures from the surface world, placed on the inside of the planet by the 
  Immortals, ostensibly to save them from extinction and preserve their ways 
  forever. And, as with any museum, there are checks and balances to preserve 
  and protect what is kept there, and so characters from the surface world who 
  somehow manage to stumble into <strong><cite>The Hollow World</cite></strong> will be in 
  for lots of surprises beyond the most obvious ones.</p>
  <p class="stb"><strong>In conclusion,</strong> <strong class="mystarared">Mystara</strong> is a 
  whole world of many diverse cultures with a distant, mythic origin that is 
  based on a techno-magical disaster. It is also a world of peers where a lowly 
  gladiator can rise to be Emperor and where those with the diligence and the 
  courage can even ascend to immortality, transcending the barriers of life 
  itself. </p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" i-checksum="15974" endspan --><p class="initial"><strong class="mystarared">ystara</strong> is being 
    converted to <strong>3rd Edition Dungeons &amp; Dragons</strong> primarily for two reasons.</p>
  <p>The first reasons is that, as a truly open-ended system, 3rd Edition 
  Dungeons &amp; Dragons is an ideal window through which to look upon a world where 
  all kinds of adventure are possible and an adventurer may one day do more than 
  just dream of becoming an Immortal.</p>
  <p>The second reason is the far more prosaic one of pragmatism; Since the 3rd 
  Edition is the most recent edition of the D&amp;D rules, it is also the one to 
  which most people will have access, and so it only seemed logical to convert 
  the setting.</p>
  <p>It is the hope of the <strong class="mystarared">Mystara-3E</strong> Project team 
  that this conversion will pique the curiosity of DM&#39;s and players who are 
  unfamiliar with the settings that make up <strong class="mystarared">Mystara</strong> 
  and the wealth of both official and unofficial information available for it, 
  ultimately encouraging them to try their hand at a <strong class="mystarared">Mystara</strong> campaign of their own.</p>
  <p>It is also our hope that existing fans of the <strong class="mystarared">Mystara</strong> 
  setting will be inclined to use this conversion effort as their baseline for 
  doing future <strong class="mystarared">Mystara </strong>development and conversions of 
  their own. By starting from this conversion as a baseline for the majority of 
	<strong class="mystarared">Mystara-3E</strong> campaigns, it should reduce the amount of work a fan has to do 
  to convert from 0E D&amp;D to 3E D&amp;D and can, instead, concentrate on the new and 
  creative aspects of her work. One need only reference this site, and provide 
  details where exceptions to this conversion are assumed and all future 
  developments for <strong class="mystarared">Mystara</strong> 
  become easier, both for the developer and for the DM who wishes to add them to 
  a campaign.</p>
