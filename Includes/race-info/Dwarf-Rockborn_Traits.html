<p class="initial">Rockborn dwarf characters have the following racial traits:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Regions</strong>: (<em><a href="../../regions.html#KnownWorld">The Known World</a></em>) 
    The dour and taciturn rockborn dwarves can be found in most places throughout 
    this region of <strong class="mystarared">Mystara</strong>, frequently acting in the roles 
    of stonemason, weaponsmith or armorsmith.&nbsp; The largest concentration of 
    rockborn dwarves is found in the country of Rockhome, which is the ancestral 
    home of their people. Other countries where rockborn dwarves are likely to be 
    found include: Darokin; Karameikos; Minrothad (esp. Fortress Island); Thyatis; 
    Ylaruam. One country you can almost be certain a rockborn dwarf is NOT from 
    is Glantri, where dwarves have sometimes been treated as little more than lab 
    specimens by wizards intent on learning the secrets behind this race&#39;s innate 
    resistance to physical damage caused by spells and spell-like effects.</li>
    <li><strong>Ability Modifiers:</strong> +2 Constitution, -2 Charisma.</li>
    <li><strong>Size and Speed</strong>: Medium size; Rockhome dwarf base speed is 20 ft.</li>
    <li><strong>Darkvision</strong>: Dwarves can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Darkvision 
    is black and white only, but it is otherwise like normal sight, and dwarves 
    can function just fine with no light at all.</li>
    <li><strong>Saving Throw Bonus</strong>: +2 racial bonus on saving throws against poison; 
    +2 racial bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like effects;</li>
    <li><strong>Stonecunning</strong>: Stonecunning grants dwarves a +2 racial bonus on checks 
    to notice unusual stonework, such as sliding walls, stonework traps, new construction 
    (even when built to match the old), unsafe stone surfaces, shaky stone ceilings, 
    and the like. Something that isn&#39;t stone but that is disguised as stone also 
    counts as unusual stonework. A dwarf who merely comes within 10 feet of unusual 
    stonework can make a check as if he were actively searching, and a dwarf can 
    use the Search skill to find stonework traps as a rogue can. A dwarf can also 
    intuit depth, sensing his approximate depth underground as naturally as a human 
    can sense which way is up. Dwarves have a sixth sense about stonework, an innate 
    ability that they get plenty of opportunity to practice and hone in their underground 
    homes.</li>
    <li><strong>Stone and Metal Craft</strong>: +2 racial bonus on Craft checks that are related 
    to stone or metal; +2 racial bonus on Appraise checks that are related to stone 
    or metal items. </li>
    <li><strong>Traditional Enemies</strong>: +1 racial bonus to attack rolls against orcs 
    and goblinoids (goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears); +4 dodge bonus against giants.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Automatic Languages</strong>: Local Regional Language, Local Common (if different 
    from Local Regional Language) and Dwarven.</li>
    <li><strong>Bonus Languages</strong>: Giant, Gnome, Terran, Local Regional and Local Goblinoid 
    languages. (Exact list of available bonus local languages varies with region.)
    </li>
    <li><strong>Favored Class</strong>: Fighter. A multiclass Rockhome dwarf&#39;s fighter class 
    does not count when determining whether he suffers an XP penalty (see &quot;Experience 
    for Multiclass Characters&quot; in <cite>Chapter 3: Classes</cite> of the <cite>Player&#39;s 
    Handbook</cite>).</li>
