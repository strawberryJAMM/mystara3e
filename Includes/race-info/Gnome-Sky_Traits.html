<p class="initial">Skygnome characters have the following racial traits:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Regions</strong>: <br />
    (<em>The Known World</em>) The skygnome subrace is almost exclusively confined 
    to the floating city of Serraine in this region of 
	<strong class="mystarared">Mystara</strong>, 
    thus an adventuring skygnome will most likely be from that city;<br />
    (<em>The Hollow World</em>) The skygnome subrace is almost exclusively confined 
    to the House of Oostdok on the floating continent of Valoin-Flamaeker in this 
    region of <strong class="mystarared">Mystara</strong>, thus a adventuring skygnome from 
    the Hollow World will most likely not only be from that floating continent, 
    but also from that House;</li>
    <li><strong>Ability Modifiers:</strong> +2 Dexterity, -2 Strength: skygnomes are less 
    hardy than earth gnomes but make up for this with increased agility.</li>
    <li><strong>Size and Speed</strong>: Small size; Skygnome base speed is 20 ft.</li>
    <li><strong>Low-light Vision</strong>: Skygnomes can see twice as far as a human in starlight, 
    moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. They retain 
    the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.</li>
    <li><strong>Keen Ears</strong>: +2 racial bonus on Listen checks. </li>
    <li><strong>Saving Throw Bonus:</strong>&dagger; +1 racial bonus on saving throws against air-based 
    spells and attacks, including lightning and electrical attacks. This replaces 
    the earth gnome&#39;s bonus against earth-based effects. </li>
    <li><strong>Flightcunning:</strong>&dagger; This replaces the earth gnome&#39;s Stonecunning ability. 
    With flightcunning, a skygnome can intuit height above ground and speed while 
    flying as naturally as a human can sense which way is up. Additionally, a skygnome 
    can also use a Spot check (DC 10) to determine if weather patterns are natural 
    or in any way affected by magic.</li>
    <li><strong>Sure Footed:</strong>&dagger; +1 racial bonus on Balance, Climb and Jump checks. 
    Skygnomes are agile, sure-footed and fearless of heights.</li>
    <li><strong>Aerial Acrobats:</strong>&Dagger; +2 luck bonus to reflex saves when attempting to 
    prevent falling from any heights greater than 10 feet. This ability only works 
    in a skygnome&#39;s natural habitat (the sky).</li>
    <li><strong>Invention</strong>: +1 racial bonus on Craft checks that are related to machinery 
    and works of Engineering; +2 racial bonus on Alchemy checks: earth gnomes love 
    to tinker and create all kinds of wonderful inventions involving strange mechanism 
    and frequently explosive chemical reactions.</li>
    <li><strong>Automatic Languages</strong>: Local Regional Language, Local Common (if different 
    from Local Regional Language) and Gnome.</li>
    <li><strong>Bonus Languages: </strong>Draconic, Dwarven, Elven and the Local Regional 
    Languages of the areas that Serraine or the flying continent of Valoin-Flamaeker 
    regularly travel over. A list of &quot;fly over&quot; regions is included in the regional 
    write up for both Serraine and Valoin-Flamaeker. Exactly which other languages 
    are available varies based on that information. </li>
    <li><strong>Favored Class:</strong> Rogue or Expert. A multiclass skygnome&#39;s rogue or 
    expert class (whichever has the highest class level) will not count when determining 
    whether he suffers an XP penalty (see &quot;Experience for Multiclass Characters&quot; 
    in <cite>Chapter 3: Classes</cite> of the <cite>Player&#39;s Handbook</cite>).</li>
</ul>
<p class="initial">&dagger; These abilities effectively <em>replace</em> the standard earth 
gnome abilities and bonuses related to earth, stone and metal: saving throws vs. 
earth based magic, stonecunning, appraisal, stone and metal craft and the language 
ability to <em>speak with animals</em>. <strong class="mystarared">Mystaran</strong> skygnomes have abandoned most of 
their ancestral affinity for earth and metal in exchange for their affinity with 
the air and sky.</p>
<p class="initial">&Dagger; These abilities effectively <em>replace</em> the standard earth 
gnome abilities and bonuses related to combat with the traditional enemies: attacks 
vs. kobolds and golblinoids and AC bonus vs. Giants. <strong class="mystarared">Mystaran</strong> skygnomes have virtually 
no contact with the &quot;traditional&quot; enemies of their earth gnome cousins and so no 
longer emphasize the skills required to attack and defend against them effectively. 
Instead they have refocused their natural skills and abilities towards dealing with 
the dangers they do encounter regularly, and thus gain an increased effectiveness 
and awareness in precarious locations.</p>
