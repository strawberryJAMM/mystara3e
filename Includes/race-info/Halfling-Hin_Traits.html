<p class="initial">Hin characters have racial traits identical to those of the core 
halfling race as specified in the <em>Players Handbook</em> [<a 
href="../../lore.html#PHB">PHB</a>], except as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Regions:</strong> (<em><a href="../../regions.html#KnownWorld">The Known World</a>)
    </em>Although the largest concentrations are, of course, found in the Hin homeland 
    of The Five Shires, pockets of Hin can be found throughout this region of&nbsp;
    <strong class="mystarared">Mystara</strong>. The most common countries that an adventuring 
    Hin might be from include: Darokin; Five Shires, Karameikos; Minrothad (esp. 
    Open Isle); Rockhome and Thyatis. One country a Hin is <em>not</em> likely to 
    be from is Glantri, where Halflings have sometimes been treated as little more 
    than lab specimens by wizards hoping to learn the secrets behind their race&#39;s 
    innate resistance to spells and energy damage.</li>
    <li><strong>Woodland Blending:</strong> +2 racial bonus to Hide checks when in an outdoor area of woods or underbrush.</li>
    <li><strong>Automatic Languages</strong>: Local Regional Language and Local Common (if 
    different from Local Regional Language).</li>
    <li><strong>Bonus Languages:</strong> Dwarven, Elven, Gnome, Lalor (Halfling), Local Regional 
    and Local Goblinoid languages. (Exact list of available bonus local languages 
    varies with region.)</li>
</ul>
