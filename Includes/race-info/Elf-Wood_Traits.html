    <h4>Inherently Magical Elves (Variant)</h4>
    <p class="initial">In 0E D&amp;D, all elves are predefined as having skills and 
    abilities equivalent to a multi-classed Fighter-Wizard.&nbsp; Although this 
    is a mechanic of the rules in use, and not, strictly speaking, defined by the
    <strong class="mystarared">Mystara</strong> setting, it did have a side effect on the 
    setting.&nbsp; Specifically, it is common knowledge across all of Mystara that 
    all elves know arcane magic and are proficient with martial arms and all forms 
    of armor.</p>
    <p>The official <strong class="mystarared">Mystara-3E</strong> conversion of the 
	<strong class="mystarared">Mystaran</strong> Wood Elf 
    uses the &quot;Elven Magical Training&quot; regional feat to emulate the traditional arcane 
    nature of elves in the setting.&nbsp; However, it must be said that the members 
    of the <strong class="mystarared">Mystara-3E</strong> Project team were highly divided 
    on whether to use this feat, which does not require all wood elves to exhibit 
    skill with magical, or to grant all wood elves an inherent magical trait, similar 
    to that of the standard D&amp;D 3E gnome race and balanced by the reduction or elimination 
    of other standard traits.</p>
    <p>Since the team was so highly divided on this issue, and the decision to use 
    the <strong>Magical Training</strong> regional feat was so close, we also offer DMs the 
    following variant option for the Mystara Wood Elf race:</p>
    <p class="initial"><strong>Inherent Magic</strong>: Wood elves with Intelligence scores 
    of 10 or higher may cast the 0-level spells (cantrips) <em>daze</em>, <em>detect 
    magic</em>, and <em>prestidigitation</em>, each once per day. These are arcane 
    spells. Treat the wood elf as a 1st-level caster for all spell effects dependent 
    on level (range for daze and duration for detect magic). See the spell descriptions 
    in <cite>Chapter 11: Spells</cite> of the <cite>Player&#39;s Handbook</cite>.</p>
    <p>To fully balance this benefit, remove the <strong>Sleep Immunity</strong> trait, including 
    the elven ability to trance rather than sleep.</p>
    <p>Note that this does not remove the <strong>Magical Training</strong> regional feat 
    from the setting entirely, as it may still be taken by non-elves who have been 
    formally adopted into a elven clan.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Regions</strong>: <em>(<a href="../../regions.html#KnownWorld">The Known World</a>)</em> 
    While Mystaran wood elves mingle freely with the other races throughout this 
    region of <strong class="mystarared">Mystara</strong> they are most likely to be found 
    in the following countries: Alfheim; Darokin; Karameikos; Glantri; Minrothad 
  (esp. Alfeisle); Thyatis (esp. Vyalia County); Wendar, </li>
    <li><strong>Ability Modifiers:</strong> +2 Intelligence, -2 Constitution: Mystaran wood 
    elves value study and contemplation over the feats of agility learned by many 
    elves of other worlds. </li>
    <li><strong>Size and Speed:</strong> Medium size; Elven base speed is 30 ft. </li>
    <li><strong>Low-light Vision</strong>: Wood elves can see twice as far as a human in starlight, 
    moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. They retain 
    the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.</li>
    <li><strong>Sleep Immunity</strong>:&nbsp; Immunity to magic sleep spells and effects. 
    In addition, wood elves do not sleep, but instead meditate in a deep trance 
    for 4 hours. (For the complete description of the elven trance, see <em>Elves</em> 
    in <cite>Chapter 2: Races</cite> of the <cite>Player&#39;s Handbook</cite>.)</li>
    <li><strong>Saving Throw Bonus</strong>: +2 racial saving throw bonus against Enchantment 
    spells or effects. </li>
    <li><strong>Keen Observation</strong>: +2 racial bonus on Listen, Search, and Spot checks. 
    An elf who merely passes within 5 feet of a secret or concealed door is entitled 
    to a Search check to notice it as if she were actively looking for the door</li>
    <li><strong>Weapon Proficiencies</strong>: All wood elves are proficient with either longsword 
    or rapier; and with shortbow, longbow, composite longbow, and composite shortbow.</li>
    <li><strong>Automatic Languages</strong>: Local Regional Language, Local Common (if different 
    from Local Regional Language) and Elven.</li>
    <li><strong>Bonus Languages</strong>: Draconic, Sylvan, Local Regional and Local Goblinoid 
    languages. (Exact list of available local languages varies with region.)
    </li>
    <li><strong>Favored Class</strong>: Wizard. A multiclass wood elf&#39;s wizard class does 
    not count when determining whether he suffers an XP penalty (see &quot;Experience 
    for Multiclass Characters&quot; in <cite>Chapter 3: Classes</cite> of the <cite>Player&#39;s 
    Handbook</cite>).</li>
    <li><strong>Magical Training</strong>:&dagger; To many outsiders, it almost seems as if every 
    elf, regardless of profession or role, has been trained in the use of some small 
    amount of arcane magic. In point of fact, traditional wood elf society has a 
    great deal of respect for those who take it upon themselves to learn even the 
    most basic tenets of wizardry. Thus, members of any traditional elven society 
    - whether membership is by birth or adoption - who also have the aptitude for 
    wizardly magic (Intelligence 10+), meet all the prerequisites for the 
	<strong>
    <a href="../../skillsfeats.html#ElvenMagicalTraining">Elven Magical Training</a></strong> regional 
    feat.</li>
    <li><strong>Fighting Magi</strong>:&dagger; Traditionally, wood elves place an equally great 
    emphasis on the skilled use of both arcane and martial training. As a result, 
    any individual who has been trained in their first level of Wizard by a member 
    of a traditional elven society (or by someone else who was so trained) are always 
    taught the skill of casting arcane magic without fear of failure due to the 
    restrictions of armor.<br />
    <em>Result:</em> Instead of gaining the <em>Scribe Scroll </em>feat at 1st-level, 
    elven-trained Wizards automatically gain the <em>Still Spell</em> feat, and thus 
    immediately gain the ability to memorize any spell in a slot one level higher 
    in exchange for the ability to cast it without fear of failure due to physical 
    restrictions of any kind (including those caused by most armor). Note that at 
    first level, the elven-trained wizard may only apply this feat to cantrips.</li>
</ul>
<p class="initial">&dagger; There are several regions in Mystara that are specifically 
known to be strongholds of traditional elven society. Where this is the case, it 
is noted where the relevant regions are described in detail (see the
<a href="../../regions.html">Mystaran Settings</a> section). A DM may define any 
community of wood elves as a &quot;traditional elven society&quot; simply by having it supply 
the benefits, and adhere to the restrictions, specified for these two traits.</p>
