<p class="initial">Earth gnome characters have the following racial traits:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Regions</strong>: (<em>The Known World</em>) Earth gnomes do not have a country 
    they call their own and they are much less common than the other core races 
    throughout this region of <strong class="mystarared">Mystara</strong>.
    <span class="redfont">Major concentrations of Gnomes can be found amongst the 
    dwarves of Rockhome, and there are several gnomish communities in the hillier 
    regions of the midlands of Karameikos</span>, most notably the gnome stronghold 
    of Highforge. Gnomes who are not from one of these larger communities are generally 
    from the larger, more cosmopolitan areas, where gemcutters, mechanics or sages 
    are in high demand. The most common countries an adventuring Gnome could be 
    from include: Darokin (esp. Darokin City, Athenos, Selenica); Karameikos
    <span class="redfont">(esp. Highforge, Specularum)</span>; Ierendi (esp. Ierendi 
    City); Minrothad (esp. Minrothad City); Rockhome and Thyatis (esp. Thyatis City);</li>
    <li><strong>Ability Modifiers:</strong> +2 Constitution, -2 Strength.</li>
    <li><strong>Size and Speed</strong>: Small size; Earth gnome base speed is 20 ft.</li>
    <li><strong>Low-light Vision</strong>: Earth gnomes can see twice as far as a human in 
    starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. 
    They retain the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.</li>
    <li><strong>Saving Throw Bonus</strong>: +1 racial bonus on saving throws against earth-based 
    spells and attacks, including acid and petrifaction.</li>
    <li><strong>Stonecunning</strong>: Stonecunning grants earth gnomes a +2 racial bonus 
    on checks to notice unusual stonework, such as sliding walls, stonework traps, 
    new construction (even when built to match the old), unsafe stone surfaces, 
    shaky stone ceilings, and the like. Something that isn&#39;t stone but that is disguised 
    as stone also counts as unusual stonework. An earth gnome who merely comes within 
    10 feet of unusual stonework can make a check as if he were actively searching, 
    and an earth gnome can use the Search skill to find stonework traps as a rogue 
    can. An earth gnome can also intuit depth, sensing his approximate depth underground 
    as naturally as a human can sense which way is up. Earth gnomes have a sixth 
    sense about stonework, an innate ability that they, like their
    <a href="../../races.html">Rockhome Dwarf</a> cousins (with whom they share much 
    in common), get plenty of opportunity to practice and hone in their underground 
    homes.</li>
    <li><strong>Stone and Metal Craft</strong>: +2 racial bonus on Craft checks that are related 
    to stone or metal; +2 racial bonus on Appraise checks that are related to stone 
    or metal items: Earth gnomes share the Dwarves&#39; particular affinity to stone 
    and metalwork. </li>
    <li><strong>Invention</strong>: +1 racial bonus on Craft checks that are related to machinery 
    and works of Engineering; +2 racial bonus on Alchemy checks: earth gnomes love 
    to tinker and create all kinds of wonderful inventions involving strange mechanism 
    and frequently explosive chemical reactions.</li>
    <li><strong>Traditional Enemies</strong>: +1 racial bonus to attack rolls against kobolds 
    and goblinoids (goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears); +4 dodge bonus against giants: 
    earth gnomes battle these creatures frequently and practice special techniques 
    for fighting or avoiding them. </li>
    <li><strong>Automatic Languages</strong>: Local Regional Language, Local Common (if different 
    from Local Regional Language) and Gnome.</li>
    <li><strong>Bonus Languages</strong>: Draconic, Dwarven, Elven, Giant, Local Regional 
    and Local Goblinoid languages. (Exact list of available bonus languages varies 
    with region.)&nbsp; Earth gnomes deal more with elves and dwarves than elves 
    and dwarves deal with one another, and they learn the languages of their enemies 
    (kobolds, giants, goblins and orcs) as well.</li>
    <li><strong>Speak with Burrowing Creatures</strong>: Once per day, an earth gnome can 
    use <em>speak with animals</em> as a spell-like ability to speak with a burrowing 
    mammal (a badger, fox, rabbit etc.). This ability is innate to earth gnomes. 
    It has a duration of 1 minute (the earth gnome is considered a 1<sup>st</sup>-level 
    caster when he uses this ability, regardless of his actual level). See the
    <em>speak with animals</em> spell description in <cite>Chapter 11: Spells</cite> 
    of the <cite>Player&#39;s Handbook</cite>.</li>
    <li><strong>Favored Class</strong>: Rogue. A multiclass earth gnome&#39;s rogue class does 
    not count when determining whether he suffers an XP penalty (see &quot;Experience 
    for Multiclass Characters&quot; in <cite>Chapter 3: Classes</cite> of the <cite>Player&#39;s 
    Handbook</cite>).</li>
