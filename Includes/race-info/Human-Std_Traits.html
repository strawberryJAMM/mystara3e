<p class="initial">Standard human characters have racial traits identical to those 
of the standard human race as defined in <cite>Chapter 2: Races</cite> of the 
<em>Player&#39;s Handbook</em> [<strong><a href="../../lore.html#PHB">PHB</a></strong>], except as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Regions</strong>: Humans can be found in almost every corner of
    <strong class="mystarared">Mystara</strong>. When developing a human character, pick a 
    character class and use the list of preferred regions for that class to help 
    with the selection of a home region. </li>
    <li><strong>Automatic Languages</strong>: Local Regional Language and Local Common (if 
    different from Local Regional Language).</li>
    <li><strong>Bonus Languages</strong>: Any (other than secret languages, such as Druidic). 
    Humans mingle with all kinds of other folk and thus can learn any language found 
    in an area.</li>
</ul>
