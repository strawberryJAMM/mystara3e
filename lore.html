  continues to extend itself into new venues all the time, requiring updates and

  made available through the Electronic SKU Download (ESD) project, into 
  3rd-edition D&amp;D (3E) materials and to make them available on personal Web

  the RPGA Living City Campaign when it was first converted to 3E. This particular resource 
  was the first taste of the Forgotten Realms campaign available to gamers, as the 
  &quot;Living City&quot; is Waterdeep from the FR Campaign World and the first edition of the

  immediately proved to be a useful starting point for the Mystara-3Econversion project as

    Dungeons &amp; Dragons. While TSR did make a limited attempt to convert
  <strong class="mystarared">Mystara</strong> into the 2nd Edition D&amp;D Rules, it failed to 
    achieve the results desired, and the whole line was ultimately canceled in 
    the mid 1990&#39;s. Unfortunately, if you are just being introduced to
  <strong class="mystarared">Mystara</strong>, this means that all original source 
    material for <strong class="mystarared">Mystara</strong> is officially &quot;Out of Print&quot; 
    (OOP). Fortunately, however, there are several ways and means for anyone to 
    acquire this OOP material.<br clear="left" />
  </p>
  <p>Much of the <strong class="mystarared">Mystaran</strong> source material has been 
  released as Electronic System Documents (ESD) &#8212; PDF documents that have been 
  generated by digitally scanning the original material, including all text, 
  graphics and maps. Released ESD can be purchased from <strong>RPG Now</strong> or 
	<strong>SVGames</strong> for a minimal cost (rarely more than $5 USD). Where ESD exist, a 
  link will be given to its location at the <strong>RPG Now</strong> and/or 
	<strong>SVGames</strong> 
  online store. </p>
  <p>For items which have not yet been converted into ESD, or if you happen to 
  be the sort who just prefers having a hard copy of the actual item rather than 
  a PDF version, it is also possible to find second-hand copies of these items 
  via auction sites such as <strong>eBay</strong> or from one of several online stores 
  that specialize in finding and distributing OOP roleplaying material.&nbsp; To 
  assist you in your search, a link to an appropriate search at <strong>eBay</strong> will 
  be provided when no ESD is available.&nbsp; In addition, a brief list of some

  over the mountains the sun set the sky ablaze. The little red creature yawns, 
  stretches its small batwings, and scratches its horny head. Suddenly, a gong 
  echoes in the room below, making the creature jump. Almost falling, it grabs 
  hold of the large statue on which it was sleeping.&quot;</span></p>
  <p class="reference-continued"><span class="comments">Down below, the students 
  are preparing for their daily barrage of courses on geography, economics, 
  history, royal lineages, and massive magical instruction (including new spell 
  research and casting). It is rumored that each of the school&#39;s instructors is 
  a member (or leader) of one of the Seven Secret Crafts - with strange new 
  abilities. All who come to or live in Glantri are searching for a secret - the 
  secret of the Radiance, a mythical force covering the whole of the 
  Principalities. Now your characters can join the adventure, with this 
  Gazetteer. Here are complete maps of the Principalities, a street map of the 
  capital, and all the information you&#39;ll need to interact with the citizens - 
  people ruled by wizard-princes, not all of them satisfied with that 
  situation...</span></p>

  <p class="reference-continued"><span class="comments">The Shady Dragon Inn is 
  a set of pre-generated characters for use with the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game. 
  This player&#39;s aid comes in two parts: each character appears first in a 
  section devoted to his or her character class. They appear again in the second 
  section as members of a party. Each character has a brief biography, a rough 
  physical description, and a list of items owned by each character.</span></p>
  <p class="reference-continued"><span class="comments">The <u>Shady Dragon Inn</u> 
  also contains the D&amp;D statistics for those characters who were released as 
  figures in the D&amp;D and AD&amp;D toy line, and provides a tavern setting from which 
  players may start adventures or gather party members. </span></p>
