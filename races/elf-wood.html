<!--webbot bot="Include" i-checksum="10467" endspan -->ystaran forest elves mingle freely with the other races 
    throughout <strong><em>The Known World</em></strong>. They are well known for their poetry, 
    dance, song, lore, and, especially, their magical arts &#8212; in Mystara, everyone 
    &quot;knows&quot; that even the lowliest elf is capable of arcane spellcasting. Most elves 
    favor things of natural and simple beauty, although there are some Mystaran 
    societies where elves have come to not only understand but respect and pursue 
    the materialistic and complicated ways of humans, such as those found in Darokin. 
    Whenever danger threatens them and theirs, whether they are in the woodland 
    homes of their traditional lands or the towns and cities of their adopted homes, 
    they quickly reveal a strong martial streak, demonstrating skill with sword, 
    bow and battle strategy.</p>
    <p class="initial"><strong>Personality:</strong> Wood Elvesare more often amused than 
    excited, more likely to be curious than greedy. With such long lives, they tend 
    to keep a broad perspective on events, remaining aloof and unfazed by petty 
    happenstance. When pursuing a goal, however, whether an adventurous mission 
    or learning a new skill or art, they can be focused and relentless. The are 
    slow to make friends and enemies, and even slower to forget them. They reply 
    to petty insults with disdain and to serious insults with vengeance.</p>
    <p class="initial"><strong>Physical Description:</strong> The forest elves of Mystara 
    are short and slim, standing roughly 4 2/3 to 5 3/4 feet tall and typically 
    weighing 85 to 150 pounds, with elven men the same height as and only marginally 
    heavier than elven women.</p>
    <p>The forest elves of Mystara have delicate features and pointed ears and are 
    generally fair-skinned and fair-haired; they tan lightly and never sunburn.</p>
    <p>In general, forest elves prefer simple, comfortable clothes, especially in 
    pastel blues and greens, and they enjoy simple yet elegant jewelry. Elves possess 
    unearthly grace and fine features. Many humans and members of other races find 
    them hauntingly beautiful.</p>
    <p>Forest elves live naturally to between 600 and 800 years old. A very few 
    have reached 1000 years old; and more have died of disease or violent deaths 
    before their 600th birthday. They take about 20 years to grow to full size, 
    then have a free-spirited &quot;adolescence&quot; of about 80 years.</p>
    <p>Forest elves do not sleep, as members of the other common races do. Instead, 
    an elf meditates in a deep trance for 4 hours a day. An elf resting in this 
    fashion gains the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep. While 
    meditating, an elf dreams, though these dreams are actually mental exercises 
    that have become reflexive through years of practice. The Common word for an 
    elf&#39;s meditation is &quot;trance,&quot; as in &quot;four hours of trance.&quot;</p>
    <p class="initial"><strong>Relations: </strong><strong><em>Dwarves.</em></strong> Forest elves do 
    not understand the dwarven work ethic or the dwarven need to create only things 
    that last, just as the dwarves cannot comprehend the elven need for the ephemeral 
    pleasures of hunting and playing. In essence, there exists between elf and dwarf 
    a deep misunderstanding resulting from total racial incompatibility.</p>
    <p class="initial"><strong><em>Gnomes.</em></strong> To elves, gnomes are more reasonable 
    than dwarves. Gnomes like the forest, work with things other than rock and metal, 
    have a lot of imagination, and a sense of humor. Moreover, gnomish inventions 
    never fail to fascinate and amuse the elves... even if they don&#39;t always work.</p>
    <p class="initial"><strong><em>Halflings (Hin).</em></strong> If there is a race that the 
    elves truly like, it is the halflings. The short folk seem to have an elf-like 
    joie-de-vivre, even without having elf-like lives. True, the halflings are entirely 
    too tied up in taming the land rather than living with it, but that is obviously 
    the influence of the humans. If halflings had the proper influence of elves 
    around, they would probably be good foresters. It&#39;s a pity about that human 
    influence though.</p>
    <p class="initial"><strong><em>Humans.</em></strong> Elves are often in awe of humans. That 
    short-lived beings can have so much adaptability, flexibility and ambition amazes 
    the elves. Yet it is amazement mixed with fear, for the elves still remember 
    tales of Blackmoor, of wrongful technology ... and the punishment of the Rain 
    of Fire, all brought on by humans. It happened once, it will happen again.</p>
    <p>Humans now like to think of elves as their friends. Yet given the choice, 
    most elves would choose not to deal with humans. When they do deal with humans, 
    they are often aloof, distant, even insulting, expressing pity in a negative 
    way; attitudes which mask the elven fear and distrust of this prolific, powerful, 
    and unpredictable race.</p>
    <p class="initial"><strong><em>Orcs.</em></strong> Orcs hate elves, elves hate orcs (though 
    the cosmopolitan elves of Alfheim Town have learned to tolerate what they think 
    of as &quot;their&quot; orcs). Records in the Mealidor Library suggest that the mutual 
    hatred predates even the oral tradition of history.</p>
    <p>Wherever elves go, it seems that orcs soon follow (or vice versa). Some scholars 
    believe the orc/elf struggle may have cosmic significance. In all likelihood, 
    the truth lies buried under the southern polar ice cap in what was once Evergrun, 
    the elven homeland.</p>
    <p class="initial"><strong><em>Half-Orcs.</em> </strong>When Mystaran elves encounter half-orcs 
    in civilized regions, they regard them with unrelenting suspicion. Half-orcs 
    raised among their orcish relations are reviled and hated as much as their orc 
    parent would be.</p>
    <p class="initial"><strong><em>Half-Elves.</em></strong> Most Mystaran elves consider half-elves 
    to be a figure of legend. These fabled creatures are thought to have all the 
    benefits of both elf and man, with none of the problems. However, throughout 
    most of the Mystaran continent of Brun, in the area identified as &quot;The Known 
    World&quot;, the true half-elf is virtually unknown.</p>
    <p>Occasionally, there are elf-human matings as the two races are sufficiently 
    similar to be inter-fertile. However, the product of such unions seem always 
    to end up being either elves or humans &#8212; although outward appearances may sometimes 
    fool watchers. As far as can be told, the elven traits are inherited through 
    the female line. The product of a union between human female and male elf is 
    always human. Moreover, the male children are always stillborn. When a female 
    elf mates with a male human, the male children are always elves, the female 
    children always human. Of course, all of these female &quot;human&quot; children have 
    the potential for growing up to bear elf or human children of either sex, depending 
    on the genetic make up of their partner.</p>
    <p>Whether the &quot;legendary&quot; true half-elf does, in fact, exist at all, either 
    as rare and possibly portentous local occurrences, or in some far distant, less 
    well known, regions beyond the borders of &quot;The Known World&quot;, continues to be 
    hotly debated among sages and scholars who care to spend time concerning themselves 
    with this sort of thing. </p>
    <p class="initial"><strong>Alignment:</strong> Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression. 
    They lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. Generally, they value 
    and protect others&#39; freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good 
    than not</p>
    <p class="initial"><strong>Elven Lands:</strong> Most elves traditionally live in woodland 
    villages containing from 200 to 500 souls. Their well-hidden villages blend 
    into the trees, doing little harm to the forest. By human standards a typical 
    elven town is a sprawling, lightly populated community<span class="redfont"></span>. 
    While a human settlement may occupy a few acres, its elven counterpart can be 
    a half-mile square.</p>
    <p>Elven villagers hunt game, gather food, and grow vegetables, their skill 
    and magic allowing them to support themselves amply without the need for clearing 
    and plowing land. Their contact with outsiders is usually limited, though some 
    few elves make a good living trading finely worked elven clothes and crafts 
    for the metals that elves have no interest in mining.</p>
    <p><span class="redfont"></span>It is also possible to find a few elven towns 
    which may hold from 500 to 3,000 elves. In addition to being larger than the 
    villages, and much more permanent in nature they have special features, such 
    as government buildings, storehouses, and perhaps the Tree of Life belonging 
    to one of the elven clans and the Tree Keepers necessary to tend it. Towns must 
    usually rely on trade with the surrounding villages to supply it with some of 
    the food it needs.</p>
    <p>Major elven homelands (i.e. regions in the Known World of Mystara where elves 
    form the dominant culture) include Alfheim, Wendar, and County Vyalia in Thyatis.</p>
    <p>Other traditional elven clanholds found in the Known World include the Callarii 
    and Vyalia clans in Karameikos, the Erewan and Belcadiz clans in Glantri, and 
    the Forster, Wraight and Shuter clans of Guild Verdier in the Minrothad Guilds. 
    These clans maintain the customs of major elven homelands to varying degrees 
    but in all cases they have resisted a complete assimilation into the other cultures 
    that surround them.</p>
    <p>Finally, the following regions of the Known World have significant elven 
    minorities: the Republic of Darokin and the Metropolitan areas of Thyatis. The 
    elves of these nations have been mostly assimilated into the dominant cultures 
    of those nations so, while they retain the normal elven interest in all things 
    arcane, they do not necessarily observe any regional restrictions or gain any 
    regional benefits that are associated with elves from traditional elven cultures.</p>
    <p class="initial"><strong>Religion:</strong> Most elven religious life among the elves 
    in Alfheim is tied to the worship of the first elven Immortal, Ilsundal. Some 
    elves, especially in the Mealidil clan, extend their worship to Mealiden, who 
    followed Ilsundal&#39;s path to Immortality.</p>
    <p>Other Immortals favored by elves throughout the Known World include Calitha 
    Starbrow, Eiryndul, and Ordana. Generally, most elves in a single clan or group 
    follow the same Immortal.</p>
    <p>Since most elves practice arcane magic rather than divine magic, many elves 
    see no need for any patron Immortal.</p>
    <p class="initial"><strong>Language:</strong> All Mystaran elves speak a single common 
    elven language, a fluid language of subtle intonations and intricate grammar. 
    Slight differences in dialect reveal the origin of the speaker but do not interfere 
    with mutual understanding.</p>
    <p>While the literature of the forest elves is rich and varied, it is the language&#39;s 
    songs and poems that are most famous. Many bards learn Elven so they can add 
    Elven ballads to their repertoires. Others simply memorize Elven songs by sound. 
    The Elven script, as flowing as the spoken word, also serves as the script for 
    Sylvan, the language of dryads and pixies.</p>
    <p class="initial"><strong>Names:</strong> Most Mystaran elves have a given name and a 
    clan name. In general, elven names tend to follow a euphonious tradition of 
    names similar to the Celtic and Norse naming traditions of our own world. There 
    are some exceptions to this general trend, most notably the elves of the Belcadiz 
    clan, in Glantri, whose names have a distinctive Spanish flavor, and the wood 
    elves of Guild Verdier, in the Minrothad Guilds, whose naming conventions have 
    been influenced by guild and the local language, resulting in clan names which 
    are descriptive of the craft each clan has specialized in. Additional details 
    about the more unusual naming traditions of such clans will be covered in the 
    write-ups for the relevant regions.</p>
    <p>Many traditional elves forgo clan names when traveling outside their homeland, 
    either because elves are rare enough where they are that there is no need for 
    identification beyond, for instance, Durfendor the Elf; or there is only one 
    clan present, such as the Callarii of Karameikos, so any elf encountered is 
    likely to be of that clan.</p>
    <p class="initial"><strong>Common Given Names:</strong> The elven naming tradition tends 
    to be somewhat unisex, though names that end in a vowel are more often applied 
    to females. Some examples include: Allandaros, Bethys, Carolotina, Delsel, Dylen, 
    Eleesa, Enoreth, Esmeralda, Feadris, Fillindyl, Galladin, Goriidel, Kavva, Leadyl, 
    Miridor, Myris, Norelia, Prestele, Qantir, Qenildor, Quillan, Shalander, Stellara, 
    Sythandria, Thalaric, Thenedain, Tuladin, Unedyrin, Vanar.</p>
    <p class="initial"><strong>Major Clan Names:</strong> <em>Alfheim</em>: Chossum, Erendyl, 
    Feadiel, Grunalf, Long Runner, Mealidil, Red Arrow. <em></em><em>Glantri</em>: Belcadiz, 
    Erewan. <em></em><em>Karameikos</em>: Callarii. <em></em><em>Thyatis &amp; Karameikos</em>: 
    Vyalia. <em>Guild Verdier of Minrothad</em>: Forester, Wraight, Shuter</p>
    <p class="initial"><strong>Adventurers:</strong> It is during the time of their free-spirited 
    &quot;adolescence&quot; that an elf chooses whether to remain in the forests of her birth, 
    or follow the wandering path of the adventurer. Most elves take up adventuring 
    out of simple wanderlust. <span class="redfont"></span>Life among humans moves 
    at a pace that elves dislike: regimented from day to day but changing from decade 
    to decade. Elves among humans, therefore, find careers that allow them to wander 
    freely and set their own pace. Elves also enjoy demonstrating their prowess 
    with the sword and bow or gaining greater magical powers, and adventuring allows 
    them to do so. Good elves may also be rebels or crusaders.</p>

    <h4>Inherently Magical Elves (Variant)</h4>
    <p class="initial">In 0E D&amp;D, all elves are predefined as having skills and 
    abilities equivalent to a multi-classed Fighter-Wizard.&nbsp; Although this 
    is a mechanic of the rules in use, and not, strictly speaking, defined by the
    <strong class="mystarared">Mystara</strong> setting, it did have a side effect on the 
    setting.&nbsp; Specifically, it is common knowledge across all of Mystara that 
    all elves know arcane magic and are proficient with martial arms and all forms 
    of armor.</p>
    <p>The official <strong class="mystarared">Mystara-3E</strong> conversion of the 
	<strong class="mystarared">Mystaran</strong> Wood Elf 
    uses the &quot;Elven Magical Training&quot; regional feat to emulate the traditional arcane 
    nature of elves in the setting.&nbsp; However, it must be said that the members 
    of the <strong class="mystarared">Mystara-3E</strong> Project team were highly divided 
    on whether to use this feat, which does not require all wood elves to exhibit 
    skill with magical, or to grant all wood elves an inherent magical trait, similar 
    to that of the standard D&amp;D 3E gnome race and balanced by the reduction or elimination 
    of other standard traits.</p>
    <p>Since the team was so highly divided on this issue, and the decision to use 
    the <strong>Magical Training</strong> regional feat was so close, we also offer DMs the 
    following variant option for the Mystara Wood Elf race:</p>
    <p class="initial"><strong>Inherent Magic</strong>: Wood elves with Intelligence scores 
    of 10 or higher may cast the 0-level spells (cantrips) <em>daze</em>, <em>detect 
    magic</em>, and <em>prestidigitation</em>, each once per day. These are arcane 
    spells. Treat the wood elf as a 1st-level caster for all spell effects dependent 
    on level (range for daze and duration for detect magic). See the spell descriptions 
    in <cite>Chapter 11: Spells</cite> of the <cite>Player&#39;s Handbook</cite>.</p>
    <p>To fully balance this benefit, remove the <strong>Sleep Immunity</strong> trait, including 
    the elven ability to trance rather than sleep.</p>
    <p>Note that this does not remove the <strong>Magical Training</strong> regional feat 
    from the setting entirely, as it may still be taken by non-elves who have been 
    formally adopted into a elven clan.</p>
    <a name="endElfSidebar" id="endElfSidebar"></a></div>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Regions</strong>: <em>(<a href="../regions.html#KnownWorld">The Known World</a>)</em> 
    While Mystaran wood elves mingle freely with the other races throughout this 
    region of <strong class="mystarared">Mystara</strong> they are most likely to be found 
    in the following countries: Alfheim; Darokin; Karameikos; Glantri; Minrothad 
    (esp. Alfeisle); Thyatis (esp. Vyalia County); Wendar, </li>
    <li><strong>Ability Modifiers:</strong> +2 Intelligence, -2 Constitution: Mystaran wood 
    elves value study and contemplation over the feats of agility learned by many 
    elves of other worlds. </li>
    <li><strong>Size and Speed:</strong> Medium size; Elven base speed is 30 ft. </li>
    <li><strong>Low-light Vision</strong>: Wood elves can see twice as far as a human in starlight, 
    moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. They retain 
    the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.</li>
    <li><strong>Sleep Immunity</strong>:&nbsp; Immunity to magic sleep spells and effects. 
    In addition, wood elves do not sleep, but instead meditate in a deep trance 
    for 4 hours. (For the complete description of the elven trance, see <em>Elves</em> 
    in <cite>Chapter 2: Races</cite> of the <cite>Player&#39;s Handbook</cite>.)</li>
    <li><strong>Saving Throw Bonus</strong>: +2 racial saving throw bonus against Enchantment 
    spells or effects. </li>
    <li><strong>Keen Observation</strong>: +2 racial bonus on Listen, Search, and Spot checks. 
    An elf who merely passes within 5 feet of a secret or concealed door is entitled 
    to a Search check to notice it as if she were actively looking for the door</li>
    <li><strong>Weapon Proficiencies</strong>: All wood elves are proficient with either longsword 
    or rapier; and with shortbow, longbow, composite longbow, and composite shortbow.</li>
    <li><strong>Automatic Languages</strong>: Local Regional Language, Local Common (if different 
    from Local Regional Language) and Elven.</li>
    <li><strong>Bonus Languages</strong>: Draconic, Sylvan, Local Regional and Local Goblinoid 
    languages. (Exact list of available local languages varies with region.)
    </li>
    <li><strong>Favored Class</strong>: Wizard. A multiclass wood elf&#39;s wizard class does 
    not count when determining whether he suffers an XP penalty (see &quot;Experience 
    for Multiclass Characters&quot; in <cite>Chapter 3: Classes</cite> of the <cite>Player&#39;s 
    Handbook</cite>).</li>
    <li><strong>Magical Training</strong>:&dagger; To many outsiders, it almost seems as if every 
    elf, regardless of profession or role, has been trained in the use of some small 
    amount of arcane magic. In point of fact, traditional wood elf society has a 
    great deal of respect for those who take it upon themselves to learn even the 
    most basic tenets of wizardry. Thus, members of any traditional elven society 
    - whether membership is by birth or adoption - who also have the aptitude for 
    wizardly magic (Intelligence 10+), meet all the prerequisites for the 
	<strong>
    <a href="../skillsfeats.html#ElvenMagicalTraining">Elven Magical Training</a></strong> regional 
    feat.</li>
    <li><strong>Fighting Magi</strong>:&dagger; Traditionally, wood elves place an equally great 
    emphasis on the skilled use of both arcane and martial training. As a result, 
    any individual who has been trained in their first level of Wizard by a member 
    of a traditional elven society (or by someone else who was so trained) are always 
    taught the skill of casting arcane magic without fear of failure due to the 
    restrictions of armor.<br />
    <em>Result:</em> Instead of gaining the <em>Scribe Scroll </em>feat at 1st-level, 
    elven-trained Wizards automatically gain the <em>Still Spell</em> feat, and thus 
    immediately gain the ability to memorize any spell in a slot one level higher 
    in exchange for the ability to cast it without fear of failure due to physical 
    restrictions of any kind (including those caused by most armor). Note that at 
    first level, the elven-trained wizard may only apply this feat to cantrips.</li>
</ul>
<p class="initial">&dagger; There are several regions in Mystara that are specifically 
known to be strongholds of traditional elven society. Where this is the case, it 
is noted where the relevant regions are described in detail (see the
<a href="../regions.html">Mystaran Settings</a> section). A DM may define any 
community of wood elves as a &quot;traditional elven society&quot; simply by having it supply 
the benefits, and adhere to the restrictions, specified for these two traits.</p>
